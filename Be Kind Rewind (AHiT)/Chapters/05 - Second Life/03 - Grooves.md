Over in DJ Grooves' apartment, however, the moon penguin was looking at things a little differently.

As he changed into cosier clothing for the night's rest, he considered what he knew of their mystery person.

From the others that had seen them, the closest shape they had of them was similar to the Kid, grown up. Her, but Mafia Boss-sized.

The other thing they knew, from having briefly seen them on the street, was that they didn't *appear* to be causing trouble - just trying to fit in. And surely the news would be circulating if they were causing mischief, making themselves known?

The thought occurred to him: perhaps they aren't from here at all. Perhaps that's why they stuck out to him and the odd crew he had made.

They must have made quite an impression to the red girl, if their first sighting of this person was then knocked out on the ground.

*That poor darling,* he thought to himself. *All alone, with no idea what's going on. I don't know their situation, but perhaps they just need guidance, someone to help them settle in.*

*You know, it's been a while since I've had a real adventure. ...Well, one not quite as dangerous as I've been having lately. Perhaps I'll take a day to travel over, and try to find them.*
