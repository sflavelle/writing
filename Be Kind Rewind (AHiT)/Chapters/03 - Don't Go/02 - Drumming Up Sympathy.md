"What is it this time, Grooves?" The Conductor growled as he entered the boardroom. "I'm *so close* to bein' done with our movie!"

"I know, I know. Lock the door. I'll be quick, darlin'." DJ Grooves gestured to a seat by him. "I just want to check up on you, to be perfectly honest. After yesterday and... well, everything."

"Well, I'm *fine*. Just shook up." Conductor's voice showed exasperation, as if Grooves was *far* from the first to ask if he was 'okay' today. There was a soft click as the lock engaged, and the Conductor eyed the penguin warily as he took his seat. "It's been a mad coupl'a months, and yet... 'tis as if it was a rotten nightmare."

"We'll take it though, right?"

"Oh fer sure."

"But that's... not all I'm asking about."

Grooves lifted his glasses away from his face, setting them down on the table. "I mean... It was about this time, the last go around that you became... different, to forgo a more appropriate term. How did the next few weeks go? Becoming more self-centered, feeding into some of your worse characteristics, right up to and after the Bird Movie Awards presentation... leading up to you *pulling a knife* on your star, and almost... eurgh... splattering her all over the walls of the basement."

"Don't remind me," Conductor spat, his features contorted in disgust. "Never thought I coulda sunk so low."

"But what about *this* time around?" Grooves rested a flipper against his colleague's shoulder. "... Are you okay, basically?"

"This time? Heh. There won't *be* a 'this time'."

Grooves tilted his head to the side.

"Look, I... I know this just sounds like I'm makin' excuses, but those Time Pieces we had... they did somethin' to my head. I wasn't... thinking the way I normally do. Ah just... how do I explain? Holdin' that much *potential* in my hands... It was exhilaratin'. I really did feel like I could do anything."

"It *was* a rather intoxicating feeling, wasn't it?"

"Ha, see, ah knew you couldn't relate. ...'ang on, what?" His head spun to face Grooves. "You felt it too?"

"Ashamed to say I did, darlin'." Grooves sighed, tilting the chair back to look up at the ceiling. "When I held them, I thought - no, I knew - I could win the Award this time." He threw his flipper out in front of him. "Surely, my losing streak would be over! I could have the past Awards that *I knew* I had deserved! I could *finally* put you in your place!"

Conductor raised both eyebrows. "Excuse me?"

"Don't tell me you don't have it comin'. 'Specially after what you pulled on our darlin'."

The owl felt like he wanted to say somethin, but couldn't find the words. He decided to let it slide for now. "But ye didn't go for it, lad. What 'appened?"

The penguin chuckled. "It's the darndest thing. It promised me so much, but I didn't think I could pull it off. So I used my movies to give them to someone who I thought could do it for me."

"The lass..."

"Indeed." Grooves sighed, and rested his flippers on his front. "Least it got into the right hands. Just, be mindful, old friend. We may not have had the Time Pieces anymore, but you and I still know a fair bit about working ourselves way too hard."

"You do?" The conductor chuckled. "And here I was, thinkin' all yer made were feel good, glorified music videos."

"Implying I don't chew through hundreds of takes trying to get my actors to perform." Grooves joined him in the laughter. 

Conductor smiled. "And whose fault is that, peckneck?" He responded lightheartedly.

"Our little diva, of course!" Grooves laughed harder. "She couldn't have come to us soon enough, darlin'!"

"We gotta get her in next year's movies!" The owl agreed, laughing with him.

The laughter lasted just a few seconds too long, and ended when the two realised there was another voice laughing with them.

Someone *in the room* with them.

"Who'ssat?!" Conductor growled, whipping his head around in search of the intruder. "I'll have yer know this is a private meetin'!"

Eventually he took notice of a strange blob of shadow on the ceiling.

As the two birds watched, something formed from it, dropping downward until it emerged completely, sat in the chair opposite them.

It was a strange entity, an almost completely black... *thing*, its only details two bright glowing eyes and a similarly luminescent fanged mouth, curled into a thin smile.

"*Hi,*" it said in a low voice.

Both birds floundered backward, crashing out of their chairs.

"**YOU!**" cried the Conductor as he got to his feet first. He recognised that figure from the castle. "Yer that Soul Snatcher of Subcon Forest, ain't ye?!"

"*Just 'Snatcher' is fine. A pleasure to meet me properly, I'm sure.*" His smile grew into a grin.

After the Conductor's shock had worn off, he pulled one of his blades from his coat and brandished it at the Snatcher. "I dunno how yer got here, but yer **not** gettin' anywhere near me soul!"

"*Any other day, birdbrain. I wouldn't even need to get closer.*" Snatcher reclined in the chair he'd chosen. "*No, I'm just playing negotiator today, and I'm rather glad I've found the both of you in one place. I'm afraid I bear the bad news that your... 'diva' is about to leave the planet for good.*"

"What have you done to her?!" Grooves got to his feet, staring the spirit down.

"If you so much as lay a finger on 'er after everything she's done..." began the Conductor.

Snatcher shook his head. "*No, this was her decision. She's... okay, look. This needs some explaining. Technically we've already met. Just, it hasn't happened yet and never will, because that future-*"

"Spare the essay, darlin'," Grooves cut in. "We're well aware of that lava castle and that red-hooded *monster*."

"*And the fact you both gave your lives? Very touching, by the way.*"

"Get to the point, peckneck," Conductor scowled, waggling his knife toward the spirit.

"*Good! This'll make this go much quicker then.*" In a poof of purple smoke, Snatcher conjured a scroll of paper. "*As you may or may not know, our kiddo arrived about the same time those Time Pieces fell from the sky. She scoured that Mafia Town, she did movies for you two for them, contracts for me, and who knows what else. She's now collected every single Time Piece on our planet as a result of undoing that recent... catastrophe. Therefore, she has no reason to hang around anymore.*" He let go of the scroll, and it poofed in front of the two birds. "*We need to* give *her a reason, or she'll vanish from right under our noses... and quite possibly for good.*"

Grooves took the scroll and unfurled it. The word 'contract' was printed in calligraphy at the top. He made a face at the other director and got reading.

Conductor watched their opponent, keeping the knife point held out. "And just what's in it for you? Erryone knows the Subcon Snatcher never offers anything without wantin' somethin' in return."

"*I don't believe I'm known to offer anything,* period."

"Exactly. What, had a change o' heart?" Conductor smirked.

"*Funny you should ask! No.*" 

"Really?" Grooves smirked, having just read the main paragraph of the text. "'Cuz a little birdie told us you two are now BFFs."

"*Oh, she told you that, did she?*" Snatcher growled in a low voice, glancing toward DJ Grooves, who had put his glasses back on so he could read the contract better. "*I should have popped her head off when I had the chance. But I didn't, and now I* can't *because of that stupid BFF contract.*"

"How *lovely*," Grooves snarked. "Because what you've written here sounds positively glowing in comparison."

Snatcher eyed the Conductor. "*Why don't you go ahead and read it out for him... 'darlin'.*"

Grooves glanced up at him, raising an eyebrow. Then, he looked back to the contract paper and read. "We the undersigned, hereby agree to form a temporary alliance for the sole purpose of encouraging- ... ah, that..." He paused to show Conductor the alien text Snatcher had carefully written out - the approximation of the kid's name. "...hereby referred to as 'Hat Kid', to continue to live amongst us on Earth.

"We acknowledge the courage of Hat Kid to stand against us when times required it, and the ability to stand *for* us when we needed it, and request her to remain with us as an equal. The alliance will form between its signatories upon signing, and this contract will be terminated on the apparent success or failure of the alliance's purpose."

"*Thank you. Happy, old man?*" Snatcher eyed the Conductor with a grin.

"There's gotta be a fine print." Conductor gestured toward Grooves for the scroll, and received it.

"None that I saw, darlin'. This has to be a first." He smirked toward the Snatcher.

"*I can put the standard soul clause in there if you* really *want. I won't say no.*"

"Eh, I'll pass." His eyes continued scanning the contract in front of him before, seemingly satisfied, he lowered it and gave a nod. "Yer showin' a different side with this, but I cannae find a problem with it."

"*I may have complicated feelings on the brat, but let me put it this way. I believe it's fair to say we all lose something if she goes.*"

"I'll agree on that," DJ Grooves said with a nod.

Conductor simply nodded in reply. "Alright, I'll join this darn alliance."

"*Excellent!*" A feather pen appeared before the Conductor, and after a moment of consideration, he took it and began to sign.

"I only have one question, mister Snatcher." Grooves raised an eyebrow. "Just how do you plan to convince her?"

"*Ah, there* is *a brain in there! I like that!*" Snatcher seemed to relax into his chair. "*Tomorrow evening, the Kid will be available to receive us in her spaceship. We'll come as a group, and make our case!*"

"Her what?" Conductor eyed the ghost, confused.

"And what if she refuses?" Grooves spoke over his colleague.

"*Then, perhaps we'll have to...* save *her from herself.*"

"...Save her."

"*It's our duty, big guy! Our duty as complete and utter bastards.*" There was a quality to Snatcher's grin that Grooves couldn't quite place, but it didn't sit well with him.

Regardless, he took the contract from Conductor, and added his own signature. "Well, I hope it doesn't come to that."

"*Who can say?*" The contract poofed away, and appeared again in the Snatcher's clawed hand. "*Don't you worry your pretty little heads about getting up there, I'll collect you when it's time.*" He stretched, and rose from the chair. "*Well! It's been wonderful doing business. If I can get the Mafia head's signature,* then *we'll be cooking. Ta ta for now!*"

And with that, the Snatcher dove into the floor and disappeared, leaving a confused and nervous Conductor and DJ Grooves staring after him.

"...Her *what*?" Conductor repeated finally, turning his head toward Grooves.

"...Oh, *darlin'*..." Grooves took a deep breath, and began to patiently explain to him that Hat Kid was not from Earth.
