Hat Kid felt the familiar jolt as the timelines settled back into place and her consciousness returned, finding herself heading up toward the command deck of her spaceship from the machinery room.

Looking about herself, it seems the timelines had realigned shortly after she'd finished filming with the directors. She'd expected time to have gone back to before she'd even landed on the planet in the first place, but, even if she knew how to work with Time Pieces, she couldn't always predict how far the Time inside them would rewind.

First things first. She strode into the command deck, climbing the ladder to the Time Vault. The display beside it read that it was full - 40/40 Time Pieces. Loosening the vault door, she pulled it open to check for herself, and smiled.

The Vault was full. Just to be sure, she counted each one, and let out a sigh of relief once she was finished.

The Time Pieces were indeed all accounted for.

She closed and tightened the vault door. She noted that she didn't feel comfortable just leaving it at that - perhaps she'd use her earnings from the film shoots to buy a good lock before she powered up the engines and *finally* resumed her journey back home.

"*Well helloooo there, kiddo!*"

Hat Kid spun around to see Snatcher emerge through the carpet. Her brow furrowed. *But... I haven't met you yet...*

"*Now, I can't say I entirely understand how your whole deal with Time works,*" the ghost began, eyeing her suspiciously, "*but I felt the need to come up and ask my most...* resilient *servant: what in the* hell *just happened?*"

Oh. "... And who are you?" she asked him carefully. After all, in *this* timeline, she had not visited Subcon Forest yet...

Snatcher's eyes widened for just a moment, before settling into an expression of unamusement. "*No, no. Don't play dumb with me, kid. If I and some of my minions remember a world covered in lava and a brat judging everyone based on her warped sense of justice, then you certainly remember.*"

The Kid's eyes widened. "What? But that's not right!" She looked down at her hands. "There's no way you should remember that. Chronologically I haven't even met you yet."

"*And yet here we are.*"

Why did he remember? Had she done something wrong? She wracked her brain for answers. Was... it something to do with the Time pocket Mu had drawn them into? "I... don't understand. This isn't right."

"*Sucks to be you, then. If I remember correctly, we should all be dead on a dead planet. But oh look, it's as if none of that ever happened.*" He twisted his form toward the viewport, glancing out toward the planet below them.

"Well, if things have sorted out the way they should have, then no, it never did." The kid walked down the ramp onto the main floor, and moved herself back into Snatcher's vision, resting her hands on her hips. "So who knows, then?"

Snatcher eyed her. "At least one of my minions knows, sounds like he was in the time... *thing* with us. I know one of them has no idea at all about it."

"Hmmm... Okay, well..." Hat Kid mentally checked off who had been present. Herself and Mu, of course. Snatcher, the directors... the Mountain Goats, some remaining Mafia, the Mafia Boss, and a few Subcon Minions, Owls and Moon Penguins. Was there someone else? ... oh, that knocked out person, but they would've returned to wherever they had come from with the rewind. Could she live with them knowing what had happened?

... She decided she was fine with it. In a strange sense, she saw them as friends now, but better they have knowledge of what can happen when messing with Time. "Well maybe you see now why Time is a dangerous thing to play with." If it disincentivises them from trying to use Time Pieces again, then so much the better.

"*Oh, you* wound *me, kiddo!*" Snatcher put on a fake melodramatic act, floating back as if onto a sofa with one of his arms raised above his face. "*How could you accuse your* BFF *of having such an ulterior motive?*"

"That contract doesn't exist."

"*Ah, but I remember writing it, and* you *remember defiling* and *signing it back in the past! Or, uhh... our past. So even if it hasn't actually happened yet, that contract (and all the others, might I add) is completely valid, whether we like it or not!*" At least, that's how Snatcher figured it worked. Granted, his knowledge in law never had to stand up to time manipulation prior to now. "*But if you must insist, I came by to ask... what happens now.*"

"Now?" Hat Kid crossed her arms. "I've retrieved all the time fuel. This ship can actually move again. I'm doing a few last minute errands, and then I'm leaving. I'm going home."

"*Wait, you're* leaving? *After everything that's happened, you're just going to* go?" Snatcher, even after everything, felt *offended*. Surely she'd stay a while? Even if it was just to make sure everything was back to how it was?

"*Yes!* I don't live here, Snatcher!" She grumbled. "I never wanted to stop here in the first place!"

"*Then why did you ever come into my- Wait, you didn't?*"

"No! I wouldn't have ever lost the Time Pieces or come down onto the planet if the Mafia didn't try to extort me for safe passage!" She put on a deeper voice, trying to mimic the Mafia's vocal tone. "*All boats must pay toll, even in space! Blah blah blah!*"

Snatcher chuckled, despite the situation. "*Can't we convince you to stay for just a bit longer? I've got another contract with your name on it!*"

"No. I've done enough, Snatcher." She sighed. "I just want to go *home*."

Snatcher was silent, seemingly deflated by her refusal. He was almost shocked by her refusal to even have more time to bother him.

She paused. "...I mean, don't get me wrong, it was kinda fun. I got to be a film star, I got to be friendly with your minions, I got to see the sights..." She scrunched up her face. "But it would've been fine if people on this planet weren't backstabbing pecknecks trying to keep things they don't know about for themselves!"

"*Kiddo, what do you* expect *from someone like myself?*"

"No, you know what?" She pointed a finger accusingly at the ghost. "I *always* expected you to double-cross me. That was never a surprise. But the *directors*? *Mu*? Those cute cats up in the mountains?"

Hat Kid walked over to the captain's chair overlooking the planet, and sat down, spinning it around to face her guest. "Time changes people. *Power* over Time changes people. It corrupts. Tells you you can fix that tiny little thing. But it's never enough. You aim higher. Fix bigger mistakes. Rewrite bigger stretches of Time. Create bigger and bigger rifts and errors in the parts of Time you neglect. It ends up... making a monster out of you and itself. That's why the world got so messed up. *That's* why we - me and my people - keep Time from being misused."

"*And... then you use it as... spaceship fuel.*"

"Yes." She eyed the Snatcher carefully.

"*Explain.*" One of his eyes widened - some equivalent to raising an eyebrow, she guessed.

"No."

"*Hmmmph.*" Snatcher glanced around himself at the interior again. "*And what did it do to me?*"

"You? It promised you power, didn't it? You tried to kill me over it."

"*I would have tried to kill you anyway, you know. I use people and then I dispose of them. I told you right at the beginning. That's my whole deal.*"

"I know, but you should have just *done it*, you moron. You shouldn't have lured me to an arena and then done some flashy display trying to defeat me instead of, I don't know, just snapping my head off my neck."

Snatcher *stared* at her. "*...I don't like how easily those words came out of your mouth.*"

"Tough. Look, I got pre-flight checks and things I gotta do. If you *really* feel so strongly about me going, then come say goodbye before I take off, hmm..." she checked her hat and did some mental calculations. "...tomorrow night. I got my family waiting for me."

"..."

"..."

"*...Alright kiddo, I will.*"

"Fine. For now, look, just, I dunno, enjoy life- uh, death I guess? Everything's back to normal, savour it."

"*...Hmm. I do have one last question, then.*"

"Yes...?"

"*Was she anyone you knew?*"

She glared at him. "What?"

"*The hooded girl. Do you two have some 'beef' with each other or something?*"

*Oh, he means Mu.* "Not before here, no. She's an Earth native. She hates the Mafia."

"*Wait- that's it? She put the planet through all* that *because she hated that Mafia Town? You're joking, right?*"

"You heard her. She didn't think it fair that everyone else was living *mostly* happy lives. That and she hated me for not abusing time to remove the Mafia from the island."

"*And, why didn't you?*"

"Snatcher, were you even listening? Changing Time has consequences."

"*Wow. She has problems.*"

"You're telling me." She rolled her eyes at him. "Is that all?"

"*...Yeah. For now.*"

"Okay. Well, I hate to be rude, but I just... I need to be alone. And then I got stuff to do."

"*...Right. Well, good talk. Later, kiddo.*"

"Bye, Snatcher. See you tomorrow, I guess."

"*You will. We're not letting you leave without a fight.*"

Snatcher began to sink back into the floor, and as he did so, he watched the kid jump back onto her feet and pace toward the machine room, murmuring to herself, "A lock, a lock..."
