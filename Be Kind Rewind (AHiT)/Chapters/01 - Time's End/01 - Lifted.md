## At Time's End

Four hundred and twenty seven steps.

Fifty degree heat so oppressive it felt as if she was being cooked alive.

Fifty-six damned Time Pieces to reclaim.

Hat Kid grumbled to herself as she climbed the final staircase, the Castle towering over her.

She really didn't have time for this.

Well, actually, now she had *all the time in the world* to deal with this new problem. Thanks to the person who had shaped this castle into being through wild manipulation of the Time Pieces.

In her case, it was because this new development had quite literally wiped any other time wasters off the map. With her ship gone dark without Time Pieces (again), and the rest of the planet consumed by lava, this was the *only* thing she could do.

But as she paused at the top of all those staircases, tired but determined, psyching herself up for whatever lay ahead, she realised something was missing.

The feeling of being watched, monitored... A feeling she had had for the weeks, months she had been on this planetâ€¦ was gone.

For the first time since she had made it to this planet, she felt truly alone.

It was strange - even when she was all alone and *knew* nobody was around, not even the Snatcher, that feeling had always been with her. She wished she could figure out what it had been, but, well, *this* was kind of a priority now.

A gust of hot wind blew past her, and she shook her head, refocusing herself. Hat Kid decided that while she'd *like* to know the answer, so long as the feeling didn't follow her once she departed from Earth, she was totally fine just letting it be yet another mystery of this wild planet.

She took a deep breath and strode for the double doors into the castle.
