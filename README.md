# My Writing Repo

This git repo contains all my writing so far, from several fanfictions and one-shots.

## Folder Structure

Each story is organised under the following structure:

Chapters > `## Chapter Name` > `## Scene Name/Identifier`

The exception is [Begin Again](/Begin%20Again/), which is also split into parts:

Chapters: `Part ##` > `## Chapter Name` > `## Scene Name/Identifier`

The story may also have a Resources folder, which holds information for me that pertains either to writing or compilation of the story.

## Currently Tracked Stories

- [Begin Again: Chronicles of an Ex-Human in Inkopolis](/Begin%20Again/)
