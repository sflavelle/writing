# My Writing Repo

This git repo contains all my writing in my new system so far, from several fanfictions and one-shots. **ALL** of my writing can be found at [my site](https://neurario.com/writing), and some can be found on *[Archive of our Own](https://archiveofourown.org/users/N448)*.

## Folder Structure

Each story is organised under the following structure:

Chapters > `## Chapter Name` > `## Scene Name/Identifier`

The exception is [Begin Again](/Begin%20Again/), which is also split into parts:

Chapters: `Part ##` > `## Chapter Name` > `## Scene Name/Identifier`

The story may also have a Resources folder, which holds information for me that pertains either to writing or compilation of the story.

## Currently Tracked Stories

- [Begin Again: Chronicles of an Ex-Human in Inkopolis](Begin%20Again)
- [Deliverer of Destiny](Deliverer%20of%20Destiny%20(BOTW))

## Why isn't X here?

In general, this repo tracks anything that's been written since my [2020 writing system](https://neurario.com/blog/2020-writing-setup) went into place.

- **The Battle for Mikea** - Way too old. 
- **Psycho Bonus Stage** - Exceptionally too old. Also, cringe.

Also, NSFW writing is not being tracked here.
