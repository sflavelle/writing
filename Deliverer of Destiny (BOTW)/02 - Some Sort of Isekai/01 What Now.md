## I Found Myself In A Wild Isekai Scenario But Am I Supposed To Be The Hero Or Just Be Along For The Ride? 

You. A character in a Legend of Zelda game.

You couldn't help but just laugh at this strange cosmic joke.

Your phone. Your wallet. Some wireless earbuds. A face mask. Some tissues. Your car keys.

*What an arsenal.*
