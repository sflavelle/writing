## I Found Myself In Some Kind Of Wild Isekai Scenario But I Don't Know If I'm Supposed To Be The Hero Or Just Be Along For The Ride? 

You. A character in a Legend of Zelda game.

You couldn't help but just laugh at this strange cosmic joke.

Your first order of business, once you find a secluded spot down by a small pool, was to see what was on your person. You searched every pocket you had, and whatever was in them was laid down gently in the grass.

Your phone. Your wallet. Some wireless earbuds. A face mask. Some tissues. Your car keys.

*What an arsenal.*
