## I Found Myself In A Wild Isekai Scenario But Am I Supposed To Be The Hero Or Just Be Along For The Ride? 

You. A character in a Legend of Zelda game.

You couldn't help but just laugh at this strange cosmic joke.

Your first order of business, once you find a secluded spot down by a small pool, was to see what was on your person. You searched every pocket you had, and whatever was in them was laid down gently in the grass.

Your phone. Your wallet. Some wireless earbuds. A face mask. Some tissues. Your car keys.

*What an arsenal. I don't think I wanna get close enough to even... I dunno, jam my keys into someone's ribs.*

If you were going to find out what was going on, you were probably going to have to explore outside of this village. To adventure you would need a weapon, and to get a weapon, you'd need money.

Your hand reached for your wallet, but stilled halfway. _Except, my money would be no good to anyone._

... Still, what good would it do to leave it lying out in the open?

You pocketed everything for now, unsure the items would be of any use.
