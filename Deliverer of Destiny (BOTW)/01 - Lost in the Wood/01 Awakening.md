## Lost in the Wood

*...*

*Ugh...*

You *knew* you shouldn't have gotten drunk on your birthday. You *rarely* drank. Sure, it was your *birthday* and all, but...

Well, you had this awful hangover now. Good going, you.

With a groan, you rolled onto your side, forcing your eyes open just a touch to look at your bedside clock.

Oh, that was a *bad* idea.

Not only was your bedside clock not there, neither was your bedside table.

Nor your bed, your blankets, or even your house.

*Oh, great. Where did those idiots leave me now?*

Yes, those two social, extroverted friends of yours whom you let convince you to go for a night on the town.

Was this a prank of theirs? It certainly wasn't a funny one.

You rolled to your left side this time, arm pushing yourself up into a sitting position. Right arm clutching your aching head as you examined where you were.

You seemed to be in a ruin of some kind, long ago reclaimed by the earth. You were up against a large tree, its roots encroaching on the ruin's walls. There was the sound of rushing water behind you, the sight of mountains and cliffs all around you, and a forest downhill from you, just ahead.

*...Where in the* fuck *is this? This is nowhere near my apartment.*

Indeed, just how far away from home were you? ...You would not know for quite some time.

You took hold of the leftover wall beside you to shakily pull yourself to your feet, your head still throbbing with the hangover and a strong pain in your knees. 

The thought rises as you look for some clue as to your location. Something, anything. Trying to tie the cliffs that surrounded you to some memory. Something that might tell you just where you were. 

But the answer never came. The sights were beautiful, even in just this little area you stood in, but there was no familiarity to anything. The closest you could get was:

_... England, maybe? That can't be right..._

Even then, you couldn't be sure that a landmark exactly like this existed in the country.

So, great. You were lost.

Carefully stepping forward and out of the ruin, you examined the ground in front of you, and stepped downhill, gradually ramping up to your normal walking pace as your body continued to awaken, slowly becoming more aware of itself and your surroundings.
