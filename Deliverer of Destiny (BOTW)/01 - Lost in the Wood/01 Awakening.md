## Lost in the Wood

*...*

*Ugh...*

You *knew* you shouldn't have gotten drunk on your birthday. You *rarely* drank. Sure, it was your *birthday* and all, but...

Well, you had this awful hangover now. Good going, you.

With a groan, you rolled onto your side, forcing your eyes open just a touch to look at your bedside clock.

Oh, that was a *bad* idea.

Not only was your bedside clock not there, neither was your bedside table.

Nor your bed, your blankets, or even your house.

*Oh, great. Where did those idiots leave me now?*

Yes, those two social, extroverted friends of yours whom you let convince you to go for a night on the town.

Was this a prank of theirs? It certainly wasn't a funny one.

You rolled to your left side this time, arm pushing yourself up into a sitting position as you examined where you were.
