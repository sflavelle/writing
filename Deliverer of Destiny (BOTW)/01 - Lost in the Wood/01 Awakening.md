## Panic! At The Unknown Location

*...*

*Ugh...*

You *knew* you shouldn't have gotten drunk on your birthday. You *rarely* drank. Sure, it was your *birthday* and all, but...

Well, you had this awful hangover now. Good going, you.

With a groan, you rolled onto your side, forcing your eyes open just a touch to look at your bedside clock.

Oh, that was a *bad* idea.

Not only was your bedside clock not there, neither was your bedside table.

Nor your bed, your blankets, or even your house.

*Oh, great. Where did those idiots leave me now?*

Yes, those two social, extroverted friends of yours whom you let convince you to go for a night on the town.

Was this a prank of theirs? It certainly wasn't a funny one.

You rolled to your left side this time, arm pushing yourself up into a sitting position. Right arm clutching your aching head as you examined where you were.

You seemed to be in a ruin of some kind, long ago reclaimed by the earth. You were up against a large tree, its roots encroaching on the ruin's walls. There was the sound of rushing water behind you, the sight of mountains and cliffs all around you, and a forest downhill from you, just ahead.

*...Where in the* fuck *is this? This is nowhere near my apartment.*

Indeed, just how far away from home were you?

You took hold of the leftover wall beside you to shakily pull yourself to your feet, your head still throbbing with the hangover. 

The thought rises to the forefront as you look for some clue as to your location. Something, anything. Trying to tie the cliffs that surrounded you to some memory. Something that might tell you just where you were. 

But the answer wouldn't arrive. The sights were beautiful, even in just this little area you stood in, but there was no familiarity to anything. The closest you could get was:

_... England, maybe? That can't be right..._

Even then, you couldn't be sure that a landmark exactly like this existed in the country.

So, great. You were lost.

Taking a few steps, making sure you felt stable enough to walk, you passed the archway out of the ruined building, ambling carefully down the hill that you found yourself on, eyes searching every which way. A lake stretched away to your right (though honestly, it was probably just part of the river that you were hearing), in front of you was a dirt path leading past you toward what seemed like a way forward. You noticed that a few signposts were set up along the road, but your hopes of some direction, or even just a town name, were dashed when you caught a glance of the nearest two, and saw that they were both... target boards.

Target boards, lined up along the road. Was this a training ground?

Well, that wasn't quite helpful at the moment.

Glancing about from the road you now found yourself on, this particular part of... whereever you were seemed to be a small nook on the road to... who knew. Actually, were those buildings to the east? Houses, up on the mountains? It seemed that way. Perhaps then, you could at least figure out where you were, and how best to get home.

First though, this hangover had to get *fucked*. You made your way over around the hill on which you had woken up, off the path slightly to where the lake waters lapped at the dirt, kneeling at the edge. You hoped to hell this water was drinkable.

Well, if it wasn't, you'd be the first to know.

You scooped some of the water in your hands, cupping it and raising it to your lips.

...Mm!

That was something else!

Besides the dirt particles that you caught up, of course.

But that water was *clean* as! Thank goodness - the fresh liquid was washing away that godawful dry, *disgusting* feeling in your mouth. You took a few sips, letting the waters refresh your mind and body, feeling more *alive*.

Now you understood what r/HydroHomies was on about.

Once you had had your fill and turned away from the lake, you finally started to walk along the path, past more ruins and-

_Are those bones?_

You thought you saw a small pile of bones against one of the ruined walls. Was this land usually occupied?

Your mind drifted back to the target boards, and suddenly the thought of being the target of a serial killer crossed your thoughts.

*NOPE. Time to get out of here.*

You made your way briskly along until the path split, one way headed slightly downhill to join what looked to be the main road. To your left and right, the road seemed to climb these cliffs on either side, eastward toward the town you had seen, and westward out of sight.

Toward the town was safety, you decided.

It was as you started on the road here and begun to climb the incline that you had your first glance of the tower on the opposite side of the valley. It was a strange structure, and a blue pipe of sorts rose through the middle of it. It felt quite familiar to you for reasons you couldn't figure out. The first words that came to mind were 'cellphone tower'. _That can't be right_, you thought, but whatever it actually was was escaping you right now.

_What a strange place this is. I don't think I'm even in my home country..._

That didn't put you at ease.

Once the road levelled out you entered into a small wood, calm and peaceful. A squirrel off in the trees caught your attention, which set your mind off thinking again. _US...? Maybe...?_

The signposts at the intersection you quickly found yourself at ruled that idea out. Written in a language you just couldn't place your finger on but reminded you almost of a runic writing. *Why can't I place this place?!*

But then you caught the flutter of a banner down one of the paths and assumed that was the way into town.

_...A town banner? That's a first. What kind of place is this? Surely this quaintness, what I've seen so far doesn't exist any more. What, am I dreaming or something?_

~~Stanley~~ You imagined yourself floating through the air, but instead a spooked animal ran across the path in front of you, and you tripped on the poor thing, crashing forward on loose footing and eventually tumbling to the ground.

_...fuck, that hurt way too much to be a dream._
