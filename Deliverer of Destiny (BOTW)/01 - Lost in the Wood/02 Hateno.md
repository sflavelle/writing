It was as you made your way up one more incline, and a villager resting by the town's 'welcome' sign, written in more gobbledegook, greeted you that things started to fall into place.

"Welcome to Hateno Village, stranger! Are you okay? I saw you take a little tumble down there."

You waved it off. "Yeah, I'm fine, just a stray animal. Happy to be here. Uh... Hateno, huh?" _Isn't that from...?_ "That's real interesting, I swear I've heard of the name Hateno before."

The old man grinned. "You're probably thinking of Fort Hateno down the road some, where all of those wrecked Guardians are."

_Fort Hateno? Guardians?! No way..._ "Huh... So was the village named for the fort, then?"

"That's right. The soldiers that held that fort many years ago slept here, brought their families here, even made new families here. It's thanks to that fort that this land is untouched by Guardians!"

You whistled in awe. "That's incredible."

"We have a lot to thank for our good fortunes here." The man smiled warmly. "But I'm sorry, you've had a long journey I'm sure. You're probably looking for the inn, right? It'll be just up the main street, on your right. Can't miss it. Anything else you might need?"

"Uhm, a map might be good."

"Town centre, straight ahead."

"Excellent. Alright, well I shan't bother you further. Thank you so much for your hospitality."

"Of course! Safe travels, friend. Enjoy your stay."

_What the **fuck** is going on._

You made it past the old man, who returned to his work, and up to a branch in the path, toward some more housing, when you caught a glimpse behind you and stopped.

Looking at the 'cellphone tower' again, with what had just happened, it now seemed obvious that you were in fact facing a Sheikah Tower. A pillar, a testament to the technology of a people who could not truly exist in reality.

At least, not your reality.

A fact that struck you as a shape caught your eye, as you made your way to the base of the banner pole, getting a better look. Something behind the tower.

It was _massive_, you could tell from so far away. A red beam emanated from it, unfocused but powerful, towards something behind the mountains, unseen but which you already knew.

You took in the view around you, once only enjoyed behind a screen but which now welcomed you, enveloped you, filling you with so much awe.
