"Greetings, traveller!" one nice elder lady called out, sat in front of what seemed like Hateno Village's inn, as you walked back through the village.

"Hi there,” you replied, walking up the wooden steps to join her, leaning on the railing. "I hope the day finds you well."

"As well as one can be nowadays," she replied. "I've not seen clothing like yours before. Are you not from Hyrule?"

You smiled. "That's right. You could say I'm uhhh, a tourist of sorts. From the far west."

"What brings you to the kingdom?" She took a sip from the mug on her table, looking up at you curiously.

"Well, I've always heard that Hyrule has some of the most breathtaking landscapes," you offered. "And though it's certainly more dangerous in recent times, I felt the urge to go backpacking across the lands, see what there is to see."

"But you don't seem to have a backpack."

"Ah yes, well..." it took you a short moment to craft a story. "I was ambushed at my camp a few nights ago. Some nasty... what are they called again? Bokoblins? They drove me away in the              night. Lost whatever wasn't on my person. Been sleeping close to the main roads since."

"Oh, dear. I'm sorry for your losses."

"It's annoying, but whatever." You smiled down at her. "I figure I can find some way around here to earn some rupees and replace what I lost. Surely there's a need for someone to do some odd jobs here and there to get me across the kingdom."

"There’s always someone willing to pay for a helping hand in Hyrule," she replied after a sip of her cup. "At least, that's been my experience. Anywhere in particular you're heading?"

You thought to yourself. You kinda wanted to see it all if you could, though that depended on your staying safe... and your stamina. "Not really. I figure I'd visit the different villages first, see the sights, maybe try to visit the Zoras and the Rito if I can. I'd have wanted to visit the castle too, but, well..."

Your friend nodded, understanding. Even for those that weren't quite familiar with the Calamity, the aura surrounding Hyrule Castle made it quite clear it was not somewhere to tread for civilians. "Well, let's see... I think a neighbour of mine has- Ah! Just the person I was thinking of!" Her attention had been suddenly diverted to someone behind you, and you turned to see a young lady in her 30s, carrying an empty wooden bucket past the inn toward the stream that passed through the village. "I was just speaking to this lovely young tourist, Lin. You're the one that has that pen pal in Kakariko, right?"

"That's me, yes." Lin, with brown eyes and long hair tied up in a bun, smiled. "I've been meaning to catch up with them, actually. All the recent happenings have put my children at the forefront as you know, dear Carrie."

Carrie, the innkeeper you had been speaking to, nodded. "Well, traveller - what is *your* name, by the way?"

"I'm (Y/N). It's a pleasure."

"Likewise. Lin, this young traveller is visiting Hyrule and wishes to see the sights. What say you if we paid them to take a letter up to your friend in Kakariko Village?"

Lin smiled. "I think that's a great idea. I would only have to write it first."

"Of course. (Y/N), would you be so kind as to do that for us on your way?"

"Gladly." You beamed. "Thank you so much."

"Of course," Carrie waved her hand, as if this was no big gesture to her. "I'm only too happy to help a friendly face get by. Shall we convene at lunch tomorrow then, Lin?"

"Sounds good, Carrie. I'll meet you both then - I best get some water boiling for the kids' baths."

"Of course, Lin. Take care." Carrie smiled warmly and waved toward her as Lin began to move. You followed suit as well.

You turned back toward the innkeeper. "Thank you again - you don't know just how much this gesture means to me."

"Hateno is always happy to help a friendly face in need," she replied simply. "I'll even throw in a free bed at the inn for the night, to get you on your way."

"I'm touched," you said to her with genuine appreciation, raising a hand to your chest. "I'll be sure to repay this kindness when I can."

"I know you will, dear." Carrie smiled. "All I ask is that you pay the bed fee when you return to our village."

"Of course."

The conversation lulled and you thought to yourself about what should be done before you left to travel to Kakariko Village...

*Well, if anything I at least need something to defend myself with... I don't want anything to get close to me if it wants to kill me, so I think I'd like a bow... and a dagger I suppose, just in case.*

*I should probably get some more... period-appropriate clothing as well, I don't want to stick out too badly and draw attention to myself. I'll need money for that though.* "Hey, don't mind me asking, but is anyone here like... buying ores at the moment? I'm trying to come up with something I could do to buy some clothing from here so I don't stick out so much to the monsters."
