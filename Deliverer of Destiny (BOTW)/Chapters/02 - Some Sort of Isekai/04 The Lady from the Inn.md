----

You started with taking your time down the hill - breathing in the sweet spring as you marvelled at the snow-covered mountains to your north, the coasts and cliffs to your south... and of course the wild and varied landscape to the west, giving you a clear view of even Vah Rudania far in the distance. More than once, you stopped to pull out your phone and record the moment.

*Y'know, thinking about it all, this is a pretty nice place to get dropped into.*

*...Monsters aside.*

Passing the windmills at the east end of Hateno Village proper, you re-entered the settlement, pausing briefly to admire the water.

"Greetings, traveller!"

You looked about, and notice a young lady leaning on the verandah of what seemed like Hateno Village's inn, just a few meters away. She was definitely looking over at you.

"Hi there,” you replied, smiling and waving, walking up toward the inn's entrance, finding a good spot to make conversation. "I hope the day finds you well."

"As well as one can be nowadays," she replied, looking you over. "I've not seen clothing like yours before. Are you not from Hyrule?"

You smiled. "That's right. You could say I'm uhhh, a traveller of sorts. From the far west."

"What brings you to the kingdom?" She took a sip from the mug on her table, looking down at you curiously.

"Well, I've always heard that Hyrule has some of the most breathtaking landscapes," you offered. "And though it's certainly more dangerous in recent times, I felt the urge to go backpacking across the lands, see what there is to see."

"But you don't seem to have a backpack."

"Ah yes, well..." it took you a short moment to craft a story. "I was ambushed at my camp a few nights ago. Some nasty... what are they called again? Bokoblins? They drove me away in the night. Lost whatever wasn't on my person. Been sleeping close to the main roads since."

"Oh, dear. I'm sorry for your losses."

"It's annoying, but whatever." You smiled down at her. "I figure I can find some way around here to earn some rupees and replace what I lost. Surely there's a need for someone to do some odd jobs here and there to get me across the kingdom."

"There’s always someone willing to pay for a helping hand in Hyrule," she replied after a sip of her cup. "At least, that's been my experience. Anywhere in particular you're heading?"

You thought to yourself. You kinda wanted to see it all if you could, though that depended on your staying safe... and your stamina. "Not really. I figure I'd visit the different villages first, see the sights, maybe try to visit the Zoras and the Rito if I can. I'd have wanted to visit the castle too, but, well..."

Your friend nodded, understanding. Even for those that weren't quite familiar with the Calamity, the aura surrounding Hyrule Castle made it quite clear it was not somewhere to tread for civilians. "Well, let's see... I think a neighbour of mine has- Ah! Just the person I was thinking of!" Her attention had been suddenly diverted to someone behind you, and you turned to see a young lady in her 30s, carrying an empty wooden bucket past the inn toward the stream that passed through the village. "I was just speaking to this lovely young tourist, Uma. You're the one that has that pen pal in Kakariko, right?"

"That's me, yes." Uma, with green eyes and white hair neatly tied up in a ponytail, smiled. "I've been meaning to catch up with them, actually. All the recent happenings have put my children at the forefront as you know, dear Prima."

Prima, the innkeeper you had been speaking to, nodded. "Well, traveller - what is *your* name, by the way?"

"I'm (Y/N). It's a pleasure."

"Likewise. Uma, this young traveller is visiting Hyrule and wishes to see the sights. What say you if we paid them to take a letter up to your friend in Kakariko Village?"

Uma smiled. "I think that's a great idea. I would only have to write it first."

"Of course. (Y/N), would you be so kind as to do that for us on your way?"

"Gladly." You beamed. "Thank you so much."

"Of course," Prima waved her hand, as if this was no big gesture to her. "I'm only too happy to help a friendly face get by. Shall we convene at lunch tomorrow then, Uma?"

"Sounds good, Prima. I'll meet you both then - I best get some water boiling for the kids' baths."

"Of course, Uma. Take care." Prima smiled warmly and waved toward her as Uma began to move. You followed suit as well.

You turned back toward the innkeeper. "Thank you again - you don't know just how much this gesture means to me."

"Hateno is always happy to help a friendly face in need," she replied simply. "I'll even throw in a free bed at the inn for the night, to get you on your way."

"I'm touched," you said to her with genuine appreciation, raising a hand to your chest. "I'll be sure to repay this kindness when I can."

"I know you will, dear." Prima smiled. "All I ask is that you pay the bed fee when you return to our village."

"Of course."

The conversation lulled and you thought to yourself about what should be done before you left to travel to Kakariko Village...

*Well, if anything I at least need something to defend myself with... I don't want anything to get close to me if it wants to kill me, so I think I'd like a bow... and a dagger I suppose, just in case.*

*I should probably get some more... period-appropriate clothing as well, I don't want to stick out too badly and draw attention to myself. I'll need money for that though.* "Hey, don't mind me asking, but is something I could do around here to earn a little bit of cash? I'm trying to come up with something I could do to buy some clothing from here so I don't stick out so much to the monsters."

"... What do you mean by 'cash'?" Prima raised an eyebrow.

*Oh, whoops.* "Sorry, 'rupees'. Currency, basically."

"Oh! I see. Well, if you have any spare bits and pieces, you could perhaps sell to one of the travelling merchants that come by here every so often. They tend to buy all types of meat, jewellery, ore, potion ingredients... even local flowers can be an easy way to make a bit of money when they come around. Hmm... But I don't think there've been any in town today..." The innkeeper thought. "I'd not dwell on it. If you've travelled here from the West without much trouble, you should be able to get up to Kakariko Village without much trouble." She smiled.

"I expected as such," you nodded. "Oh well. Okay. Well, I suppose I'll get situated then, and I'll check in tonight to get plenty of rest."

Prima smiled. "That's no trouble at all. I won't keep you further. I'll be open as late as you need."

"Thanks." You smiled - at least bedding was sorted. "I'll be seeing you soon then!" With a wave, you started to turn away.

"Of course. Be safe!" She responded, with a gentle wave back.

So now you had something to do - something to distract you from the reality that you were stuck in this land.

And why not play mailman, if it gave you a reason to explore the world you found yourself in?
