*Uuughh my legs-*

The trek up the path toward the Lab was steeper than it seemed inside the game.

The burn had started about a third of the way up, after you had passed a small farmhouse. After that though, the path grew steeper and you had to be careful with your footing, lest you slip in the softer dirt, or trip over a tree root.

But you forced yourself up the path, telling yourself that this wouldn't be as trying or difficult as the future journeys you would take across this land.

And then you had made it, to the top of the hill on which stood the Hateno Ancient Tech Lab.

You noted the lit furnace and the beautiful scenery around you, and the village below, and you allowed yourself to relax.

You allowed yourself to realise that you didn't have to be a hero. You *just* had to survive Hyrule itself.

You had to remind yourself that that would likely still be a challenge in itself, but a much less daunting one.

You fumbled in your pocket for your phone, took it out, and took a photo of the landscape facing south toward the village.

*With these views, though... I don't think I'll mind it.*

And then you let yourself have a few minutes, seated near the path, to enjoy the view before you started to trek downward again.

*Now what on earth am I gonna do...?*
