You walked up the village path, smiling at the few townspeople who called out to you, waving at the children who passed you.

Hateno Village, draped lovingly on the hillside, was a town that felt like it had existed for hundreds of years. There was something about the buildings here, now that you were seeing them up close, that felt as if you were in a European countryside, untouched by the Industrial Revolution. Despite your life previously relying on such things as the Internet, something about this place brought you peace, even in your current situation.

Hopefully that meant it would continue to be untouched during your stay here.

Which meant you could turn your attention to the problem at hand: *How do I tell if I'm supposed to stand in for Link here?*

You pondered this all the way up the path, and as you reached the mountain path that led up to the Ancient Tech Lab, you had come up with a few solutions.

*Okay. One: That Divine Beast out toward Gerudo Valley looks like it's ready to fire toward Hyrule Castle. That means it's tamed. Link has been here.*

*Two: Same with Vah Rudania over on Death Mountain. Good thing too, I'm not that fond of the idea of working near lava.*

*Three: I think, if I just get up to the Tech Lab up here, I can see whether the blue flame that powers their Sheikah rune has been lit or not.*

*If so, I can take all three of these things as a sign to relax.*

And so, you started up the path winding up the mountain toward the Hateno Ancient Tech Lab.
