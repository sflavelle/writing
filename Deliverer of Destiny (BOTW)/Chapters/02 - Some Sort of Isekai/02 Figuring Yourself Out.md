You walked up the village path, smiling at the few townspeople who called out to you, waving at the children who passed you.

"Greetings, traveller!" one nice elder lady called out, sat in front of what seemed like Hateno Village's inn, further up the path.

"Hi there, you replied, walking up the wooden steps to join her, leaning on the railing. "I hope the day finds you well."

"As well as one can be nowadays," she replied. "I've not seen clothing like yours before. Are you not from Hyrule?"

You smiled. "That's right. You could say I'm a tourist of sorts. From the far west."

"What brings you to the kingdom?" She took a sip from the mug on her table, looking up at you curiously.

"Well, I've always heard that Hyrule has some of the most breathtaking landscapes," you offered. "And though it's certainly more dangerous in recent times, I felt the urge to go backpacking across the lands, see what there is to see."

"But you don't seem to have a backpack."

"Ah yes, well..." it took you a short moment to craft a story. "I was ambushed at my camp a few nights ago. Some nasty... what are they called again? Bokoblins? They drove me away in the              night. Lost whatever wasn't on my person. Been sleeping close to the main roads since."

"Oh, dear. I'm sorry for your losses."

"It's annoying, but whatever." You smiled down at her. "I figure I can find some way around here to earn some rupees and replace what I lost. Surely there's a need for someone to do some odd jobs here and there to get me across the kingdom."
