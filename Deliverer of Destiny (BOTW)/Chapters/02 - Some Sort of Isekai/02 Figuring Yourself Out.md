You walked up the village path, smiling at the few townspeople who called out to you, waving at the children who passed you.

Hateno Village, draped lovingly on the hillside, was a town that felt like it had existed for hundreds of years. There was something about the buildings here, now that you were seeing them up close, that felt as if you were in a European countryside, untouched by the Industrial Revolution. Despite your life previously relying on such things as the Internet, something about this place brought you peace, even in your current situation.

Surely the people here could help you get yourself sorted?

"Greetings, traveller!" one nice elder lady called out, sat in front of what seemed like Hateno Village's inn, further up the path.

"Hi there,” you replied, walking up the wooden steps to join her, leaning on the railing. "I hope the day finds you well."

"As well as one can be nowadays," she replied. "I've not seen clothing like yours before. Are you not from Hyrule?"

You smiled. "That's right. You could say I'm uhhh, a tourist of sorts. From the far west."

"What brings you to the kingdom?" She took a sip from the mug on her table, looking up at you curiously.

"Well, I've always heard that Hyrule has some of the most breathtaking landscapes," you offered. "And though it's certainly more dangerous in recent times, I felt the urge to go backpacking across the lands, see what there is to see."

"But you don't seem to have a backpack."

"Ah yes, well..." it took you a short moment to craft a story. "I was ambushed at my camp a few nights ago. Some nasty... what are they called again? Bokoblins? They drove me away in the              night. Lost whatever wasn't on my person. Been sleeping close to the main roads since."

"Oh, dear. I'm sorry for your losses."

"It's annoying, but whatever." You smiled down at her. "I figure I can find some way around here to earn some rupees and replace what I lost. Surely there's a need for someone to do some odd jobs here and there to get me across the kingdom."

"There’s always someone willing to pay for a helping hand in Hyrule," she replied after a sip of her cup. "At least, that's been my experience. Anywhere in particular you're heading?"

You thought to yourself. You kinda wanted to see it all if you could, though that depended on your staying safe... and your stamina. "Not really. I figure I'd visit the different villages first, see the sights, maybe try to visit the Zoras and the Rito if I can. I'd want to visit the castle too, but, well..."

Your friend nodded, understanding. Even for those that weren't quite familiar with the Calamity, the aura surrounding Hyrule Castle made it quite clear it was not somewhere to tread for civilians. "Well, let's see... I think a neighbour of mine has- Ah! Just the person I was thinking of!" Her attention had been suddenly diverted to someone behind you, and you turned to see a young lady in her 30s, carrying an empty wooden bucket past the inn toward the stream that passed through the village. "I was just speaking to this lovely young tourist, Lin. You're the one that has that pen pal in Kakariko, right?"

"That's me, yes." Lin, with brown eyes and long hair tied up in a bun, smiled. "I've been meaning to catch up with them, actually. All the recent happenings have put my children at the forefront as you know, dear Carrie."

Carrie, the innkeeper you had been speaking to, nodded. "Well, traveller - what is *your* name, by the way?"

"I'm (Y/N). It's a pleasure."

"Likewise, (Name). Lin, this young traveller is visiting Hyrule and wishes to see the sights. What say you if we paid them to take a letter up to your friend in Kakariko Village?"

Lin smiled. "I think that's a great idea. I would only have to write it first."

"Of course. (Name), would you be so kind as to do that for us on your way?"

"Gladly." You beamed. "Thank you so much."

"Of course," Carrie waved her hand, as if this was no big gesture to her. "I'm only too happy to help a friendly face get by. Shall we convene at lunch tomorrow then, Lin?"

"Sounds good, Carrie. I'll meet you both then - I best get some water boiling for the kids' baths."

"Of course, Lin. Take care." Carrie smiled warmly and waved toward her as Lin began to move. You followed smiled as well.

You turned back toward the innkeeper. "Thank you again - you don't know just how much this gesture means to me."
