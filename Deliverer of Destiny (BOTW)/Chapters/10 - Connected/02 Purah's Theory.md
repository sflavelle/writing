----

Touching down outside the Hateno Ancient Tech Lab the next morning, you took a moment to gaze north. Though you could not see the Zora's Domain from here, you could spot the soft red glow of Vah Ruta's beam between the hills as it pointed toward the corrupted Hyrule Castle.

The enormity of what had transpired hit you rather suddenly.

That was *your* doing.

*You* had tamed the Divine Beast.

Beginner's luck? Perhaps...

Hopefully Link was... recovering.

Turning away, you stepped toward the doorway and knocked, before turning the handle and stepping in. "It's me," you called, smiling.

The inside of the Tech Lab was a mess of papers today. Director Purah was writing in her notepad when you arrived, and her eyes shot up to take you in. "(Y/N)!" She squealed, and started hurrying about the building, gathering books, bits and pieces. Symin, in the back, waved hello. "Just the person I was hoping for! So! Did the Sheikah Slate receive my message? How were the Zora? Did you do something about that Divine Beast?"

"Uhhh." You probably should have expected to be assaulted by so many questions. "Yes, better now, and... amazingly yes. Vah Ruta is saved from Ganon."

"OOOH! Excellent!" Purah rushed to lift something long from the table - heavy, it seemed, from how she was handling it - and pressed it into your hands such that your right hand automatically gripped the handle on the end. "Here, hold this for a sec. My sister was right to trust in you then."

"Well, I mean..."

"You know, at first I thought to myself, ' there's no way some stranger from another world could help us, post-Calamity.'" She started writing in her notepad again, looking you over.

"Gee, thanks," you laughed. "That's why I started by delivering mail. How would I know I was a half-decent fighter?"

"Modest as ever. But something about it has been bothering me, so I turned to our history, and well, in my search for answers about you I ended up reading up on legends and tales from the ancient Sheikah. (Y/N), did you know there is a theory written by the ancient Sheikah about a recurring conflict in history, involving a Hylian princess, a hero, and a manifestation of evil?"

"How do you mean?" Your brows furrowed.

"They say that the princess of Hyrule is plagued by the Curse of Demise. That an entity called Ganon will continue to manifest itself to shroud this world in darkness, and a hero will continue to rise to stop him."

"Huh?" You found yourself pretending you didn't know of multiple games in this universe where exactly this was the case.

"It sounds crazy, doesn't it? But it's already happened, 10,000 years ago. That's very clear in our history. And there are legends in Hyrule's vast history that would corroborate its truth. Books that, though their homes are long destroyed, have carried on to the present day."

Purah turned and started to rummage through a pile of books on her desk. "This one," she said, lifting one up to you, "is a supposedly fictional account about a boy who could travel through time to save his kingdom from a man from the Gerudo Valley. And another," she discarded the first book to her desk and picked up another, "tells of a young man who tried to save his father, and ended up saving a princess and sent on a quest to prevent an evil beast from being summoned."

"So what are you saying about now? What am I holding, anyway?" You glanced down and noticed the unique handle... more of a hilt, actually. "Wait, isn't this-"

"The Master Sword, yes," Purah waved off the question.

"Wh- **Purah**!" You fumbled the sword briefly, before deciding to quickly set it down against a table. It was in its sheath, which seemed to be why you and Purah were able to hold it, but you didn't want to take the chance of it acting against you. "Can't this sword only be used by Link?!"

"So we thought," she replied with an odd look. "Look, (Y/N). I think that, though I'm sure these tales are embellished, they tell of true past events. Almost all of them involving a princess, her hero, and a being of evil. I'm sure we're living through that curse right now."

"Why's that?"

"Because, (Y/N), neither side of that battle between the Champions and Calamity Ganon one hundred years ago has actually won yet. Link may have been on death's doorstep, but we acted quickly enough to save his life so that he could return and defeat Ganon. And Princess Zelda is of course still alive, in some fashion, holding the Calamity back from the untold destruction of our kingdom, waiting for him."

"But Link *is* gone now, isn't he? Surely he can't survive after how we found him." It hurt to say so...

"...It's possible. He will be a devastating loss to our kingdom. ...But then *you* come along. Fully formed, ready to help our kingdom, in one way or another. And despite your circumstances, *you* brave the wilds to help the people of Hyrule. *You* put yourself in danger to get Link's body to safety. And, courageously, *you* manage to liberate a Divine Beast from Calamity Ganon, bringing us up to three of the four Divine Beasts back in our control."

She turned to face you. "(Y/N), Impa and I have been discussing this, and we posit to you that either you are an awakening hero, or, considering the curse, a reincarnation of our hero Link."

The room was silent as you processed what was said. How can that be? You're not even a fighter in your world!

"...How do you figure that?" You asked slowly, skeptical.

Purah smiled warmly up at you. "That Master Sword is the last piece of the puzzle. It allowed you to hold it. It's said that that mystical blade can only be wielded by the person who is pure of courage." She paused, taking a breath. "Under normal circumstances, that is Link..."

She walked over to the sword, set next to the table, and holding it by the sheath, tilted it toward you. "Trust me. Unsheathe the sword. If I'm right, you'll be able to wield it like the Champion Link."

You blinked. "And if it... doesn't like me?"

The Sheikah shrugged. "It might start sapping your energy and life."

"Uhhhh!"

"Oh relax! If I'm wrong - and may I add, I'm not - you can just let go of it."

"Are you *sure*?"

"(Y/N), you already *held* the sword. Twice, may I add - including just before. Just work with me here."

You sighed deeply. Surely, this was just silly. Yes, she'd forced the hilt into your hand and nothing had come of it, but surely nothing good would come of some random person coming up and...

Your hands shook slightly as you reached for it, hesitating for a few moments before slowly wrapping your fingers around the hilt of the sword.

Nothing happened. Just the sensation of finely crafted metal and leather wrapping resting on your skin. Strangely, you felt just the smallest hint of warmth from somewhere within. You took a few deep breaths, just letting your hand stay, wondering if you felt anything happening.

But it was as calm as it had been. As calm and unable to inflict magical pain upon you as an unused blade should be.

"Come on, (Y/N)," Purah breathed.

You glanced up at her, and after another moment's pause, slowly pulled upward.

The Master Sword slid carefully, cleanly from its sheath. The blade was as clean as the day it was created. The crest of the Triforce engraved upon it was prominent and instilled in you a sense of awe as it revealed itself. This was truly a magical moment to witness, you realised to yourself. 

And then-

And then the point of the sword was free from the sheath, and you were holding the entire thing in your hand, and it occurred to you how *solid* this blade was.

You were holding the *Master Sword*.

The *Blade of Evil's Bane*.

The *sword that seals the darkness*.

How on Earth did this journey keep getting stranger?

You carefully held the sword up to the light, inspecting it and adjusting to its weight. The warmth you felt from it grew warmer as you adjusted to it. Was it also adjusting to you?

"Well then..." Purah stared at you and the blade with a sense of almost reverence. "How do you feel?"

"I uh..." you gently ran your fingers over the engraved symbol on the blade. "Honestly? I'm stunned."

"Hmm. Same old you?"

"Eh?" 

"Haven't remembered any past lives or anything?"

"Uuuhhh... no...?" You raised an eyebrow and, examination over, let your hands fall to your sides - carefully, in the case of the hand holding the sword. "I get what you're asking, and no, I don't feel anything... different."

"Hmmph." Purah almost seemed disappointed. "Well, this is still quite an event in itself, wouldn't you say?"

"I suppose. ...Wow, I'm surprised it is letting me hold it."

"...*How*? I just told you that you could."

"Yeah, but- Purah. For one, I've never been a hero. For two, I've never been to Hyrule before. For three, *surely* the goddesses didn't intend for some nobody from another *universe* to just show up and steal Link's thunder!"

"Steal *your* thunder."

"Pardon?"

"Well in any case, I think that settles it, *Linky*!" Purah recovered herself and retreated back to her notepad. "Right! Well, you're headed for Rito Village, right?"

Your brow shot up. "Uh, I suppose, but--"

"Good! Then get to it! The princess can't wait forever!" She started pushing you toward the door.

"Sure, but did you-"

"Come by when this is all over and we'll figure it out!"

"Wh-"

"Byeee!" The slam of the front door behind you told you that your stay at the Lab was over.

You slowly turned and stood facing the building, still holding the sword in your hand, dumbfounded.

*...Forget the Master Sword, did she just call me* Link?

*... Who am I, really?*
