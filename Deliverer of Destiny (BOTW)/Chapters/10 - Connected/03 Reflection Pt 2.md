The walls of the entrance to the Shrine of Resurrection were bathed in blue as you materialised inside the room.

It looked just as you last saw it - dusty and seemingly untouched, though the footprints of yourself and Purah (and Link himself, sometime before you both) were the only indication that anyone had been here since the one hundred years of the Hero's slumber.

You walked up to the Sheikah pedestal, Slate already in hand as you hovered it over the pedestal's surface. You were getting used to this - it was like using tap-and-pay on EFTPOS readers.

The door to the Chamber of Resurrection opened, and you stepped inside.

There was a gentle mechanical hum coming from the structure in the middle. And there was no need to look inside to know that Link was nowhere near ready to fight again. It had taken a century last time, and he hadn't been in as bad a shape as this.

Regardless, as the door closed behind you and you took a seat on the floor beside his tomb, you didn't need a dead man to listen. You just needed to talk *at* him, talk your way through the thoughts and feelings swimming through your head.

After all, you had reasoned to yourself, if people are going to throw all this talk about *The Hero* at you, you should at least involve the *actual* Hero.

In some small way.

"Hey," you greeted him.

No response. Of course.

"I... thought you'd want to know that... y'know. Hyrule isn't just resting on its laurels waiting for you to come back."

...you sigh. You feel a twinge of regret. You shouldn't be burdening someone with this, especially if they're dead.

On the other hand, Link hasn't complained yet.

"Purah and I... we figured out a way to go on. In your absence. We... We took back Vah Ruta."

You paused. You wanted to look at him, to *see* him. But considering the condition his corpse was in when you found him, and how you had been sick just seeing him the first time...

Great, now you were just thinking about that again.

"She... Umm... People think... I might be you. Reincarnated or something."

For a brief moment you expect some surprised retort to this.

"I can't see how. I can't be a hero of your calibre, just because I am actually... trying to do something about this situation. If I... had my way, I'd still be travelling about Hyrule."

You almost missed those early days...

But as you stared up into the ceiling of the chamber, slowly your eyes drifted downward and fell upon the Master Sword in its sheath, beside you.

"...I could wield your blade. I don't know how. Apparently that's the decider for Purah. What is it, someone of pure courage? Avatar of courage? I dunno. I don't want to use it though. Unless I need to. I guess if I'm now set on your path that means I'll need to... Holy shit, I might have to face the Calamity."

That was something you hadn't yet had to consider. You stood up, leaving the sword by the pool as you paced about, having made yourself nervous.

"O-okay, I should really just focus on the next task and... oh no, that's the Rito one, isn't it? I have to get up into the sky? Fuck, man... See Link, I can't be you. I don't think I'm scared of heights but holy hell, I don't want to be on some floating machine floating up above the clouds. Surely you would have taken that as a challenge."

"*On the contrary, Master.*"

It was a feminine, musical voice, with a quality that you had never heard before, speaking in a way that seemed to echo toward you. You spun about, looking around, trying to find its source.

And then a figure seemed to simply form by the pool, near where you had left the Master Sword. An ethereal blue coloured a body that was clearly not human and yet tried to resemble one. It stared toward you through a face with no pupils and no mouth.

And yet, it spoke, with the same voice you had heard. As it watched you, the figure continued, "*Though your skill set is reduced compared to the Champion Link, your emotional profile is at least 85% identical based on preliminary data. He would most likely have reacted in the same manner.*"

You stared at her, jaw dropped. You recognised this being, but...

"...*Fi*?"
