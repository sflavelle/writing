You decided to believe that you were on solid ground when you alighted onto the Divine Beast Vah Medoh. Even if it was hundreds of meters above the ground, you felt more comfortable on it than you did on the Teba's back, strong as he was - or floating about with the paraglider.

Standing on the landing platform, noting that the Sheikah travel sign was lighting up - accompanied by a notification chime from the Slate on your hip as the ability to warp here became available - you gave yourself a minute or two to take deep breaths, pushing the stressful situation of a few minutes ago away from you and refocusing yourself on the task ahead.

Five terminals. Well, six - including the map of this place. Six terminals, six puzzles, another Blight, and then...

Then all four Beasts would be back in the control of the champions.

Then, perhaps, you could consider this 'resurrection' process, before taking this fight back to Ganon itself.

"*You're not Link.*"

A male voice, spoken from the aether, interrupted your thoughts. In those three words you could hear his simultaneous disbelief and disappointment. *This isn't the person he expected to rescue him and Medoh.*

It was of course the voice of Sean Chiplock. Playing the character of Revali, of course. But of course not in this universe... "Yes and no, Revali. It's a long story." You turned, toward the entrance that led into the Beast proper.

"*Much as I appreciate the company, this is far from a safe place for a Hylian. Head back to wherever-*"

"Just because I don't look like Link doesn't mean I'm not Link." You smirked a little, as you checked that your selected weapons were still secure.

"*That doesn't make any sense.*"

"You're right, it doesn't. But who else would try *and succeed* to come all the way up here?"

"*Oh let's see. Perhaps a* Rito?" The voice of Revali scoffed. "*A true warrior race? With, work with me here,* wings?"

"How do you think I got up here? How do you think we disabled the shields on this thing?"

"*I refuse to believe this mystical Rito of yours would have just left you to face-*"

"You want your Divine Beast or not?" You didn't want to spend the whole day arguing this point, so you fished out your earbuds and began to put them on.

The voice was silent as, with the buds in, the noise of the wind reduced down to a quiet whisper. You pulled your phone from your pocket and looked through it, looking for an appropriate song to tackle the Beast's challenges with.

"*...What are you /doing/?*" Almost unfortunately, Revali's voice came to you exactly as before, unhindered by your earbuds.

"Cleansing a place like this needs some dope tunes." You paused briefly, coming up with an idea, and looked for the Doom 2016 soundtrack in your library.

"*...What? What in the Goddesses did you just say?*"

"Rip and tear, birdo." With that, you tapped '[BFG Division](https://youtu.be/QHRuTYtSbJQ)' on the phone, which started to play its intro, and you slipped your phone back into your pocket, in favour of unsheathing the Master Sword. "Until it is done."

"*Oh, /wonderful/.*" The Champion's voice sighed in defeat. "*I'm being visited by a /psychopath/.*"

You couldn't help but laugh at the comment. You checked your equipment one last time, and steeled yourself for what might lay ahead. "Right. The map terminal."

"*... What in Hylia is this* noise *you're listening to? Is this meant to be music?*"

"'Meant to be'? It *is*." *Wait, he can hear the music in your earbuds?*

"*...You're very strange for a Hylian, you know.*"

"Oh, I'm--" You stopped briefly, thinking to yourself - *Wait, if I'm... I /am/ Hylian aren't I? Does it matter?* - but then you noticed the song was about to start it's aural assault on your ears, and it didn't matter anymore. Sword at the ready, and threading your arm into the shield, you finished, "I know. It's too late. Let's do this."

As soon as the beat finally dropped, you were almost *sprinting* into the Divine Beast, energised by the track, ready to take down any Guardians or other monsters in the way.

But it didn't take much for the momentum to die off.
