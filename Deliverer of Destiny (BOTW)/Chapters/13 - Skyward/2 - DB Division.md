You decided to believe that you were on solid ground when you alighted onto the Divine Beast. Even if it was hundreds of meters above the ground, you felt more comfortable on it than you did on the Teba's back, strong as he was - or floating about with the paraglider.

Standing on the landing platform, noting that the Sheikah travel sign was lighting up - accompanied by a notification chime from the Slate on your hip as the ability to warp here became available - you gave yourself a minute or two to take deep breaths, pushing the stressful situation of attacking the Beast's shield away from you and refocusing yourself on the task ahead.

Five terminals. Well, six - including the map of this place. Six terminals, six puzzles, another Blight, and then...

Then all four Beasts would be back in the control of the champions.

Then, perhaps, you could consider this 'resurrection' process, before taking this fight back to Ganon itself.

"*You're not Link.*"

A male voice, spoken from the aether, interrupted your thoughts. In those three words you could hear his simultaneous disbelief and surprise. *This isn't the person he expected to rescue him and the Divine Beast.*

It was of course the voice of Sean Chiplock. Or rather... "Yes and no, Revali. It's a long story." You turned, toward the entrance that led into the Beast proper.

"*Much as I appreciate the company, this isn't a safe place for a Hylian. Head back to wherever-*"

"Just because I don't look like Link doesn't mean I'm not Link." You smirked a little, as you checked that your selected weapons were still secure.

"*That doesn't make any sense.*"

"You're right, it doesn't. But who else would try *and succeed* to come all the way up here?"

"*Oh let's see. Perhaps a* Rito?" The voice of Revali scoffed. "*A true warrior race? With* wings?"

"How do you think I got up here? How do you think we disabled the shields on this thing?"

"*I refuse to believe this mystical Rito of yours would have just left you to face-*"

"You want your Divine Beast or not?" You didn't want to spend the whole day arguing this point, so you fished out your earbuds and began to put them on.

The voice was silent as, with the buds in, the noise of the wind reduced down to a quiet whisper. You pulled your phone from your pocket and looked through it, looking for an appropriate song to tackle the Beast's challenges with.

"*...What are you /doing/?*" Almost unfortunately, Revali's voice came to you exactly as before, unhindered by your earbuds.

"Cleansing a place like this needs some dope tunes." You paused briefly, coming up with an idea, and looked for the Doom 2016 soundtrack in your library.

"*...What? What on Earth did you just say?*"

"Rip and tear, birdo." With that, you tapped '[BFG Division](https://youtu.be/QHRuTYtSbJQ) on the phone, which started to play its intro, and you slipped your phone back into your pocket, in favour of the Master Sword. "Until it is done."

"*Oh, /wonderful/.*" The Champion's voice sighed in defeat. "*I'm being rescued by a /psychopath/.*"
