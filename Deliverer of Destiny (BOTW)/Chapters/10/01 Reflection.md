That night, you returned to the dam, content to remove yourself from the happy festivities of the Domain below.

The last two days had upended your life yet again, and so you had taken the chance to dip your feet in the water, lay on your back and watch the stars float by.

In your cone of vision, Vah Ruta had taken its position, guided by Mipha's spirit. The laser aimed precisely at the sanctum of Hyrule Castle was soft, unfocused. Waiting for the moment to take aim, for the first and final time.

_One more to be freed. And then..._

"Ah, I thought you might be up here."

You turned your head. The now familiar deep, well-spoken voice of Prince Sidon had come from your left, as he climbed the steps to meet you once more. "I noticed that the hero who freed the Divine Beast Vah Ruta from the Calamity was nowhere to be seen. Is everything alright, Hylian?"

Your eyes flickered up to his. "Link had to keep moving, sadly. A hero's work is never finished."

"Had you not told me that he..." A pause, punctuated by confusion on his features. Then it softened. "Ah... I see."

You sat up as he lowered himself to sit nearby. Even now his form towered above yours. A part of you felt it rather impressive. "Won't the city miss you if you're up here, Prince?" 

"I've done my part for tonight," he grinned toothily at you. "No one will mind if I catch my breath." 

You chuckled, and your gaze drifted up toward the Divine Beast again, it's gentle blue glow illuminating it's features. Neither of you spoke for a minute. 

"You... Don't fancy yourself a hero, do you?"

You turned to face the Zora. "... Not really. It's not something I'd normally want to make a habit of."

"What would you be doing otherwise?"

"... Travelling, delivering mail, I suppose."
