That night, you returned to the dam, content to remove yourself from the happy festivities of the Domain below.

The last two days had upended your life yet again, and so now that there was some peace brought to the Domain, you had taken the chance to dip your feet in the water, lay on your back and watch the stars float by.

In your cone of vision, Vah Ruta had taken its position, guided by Mipha's spirit. The laser aimed precisely at the sanctum of Hyrule Castle was soft, unfocused. Waiting for the moment to take aim, for the first and final time.

_One more to be freed. And then..._

"Ah, I thought you might be up here."

You turned your head. The now familiar deep, well-spoken voice of Prince Sidon had come from your left, as he climbed the steps to meet you once more. "I noticed that the hero who freed the Divine Beast Vah Ruta from the Calamity was nowhere to be seen. Is everything alright, Hylian?"

Your eyes flickered up to his. "Link had to keep moving, sadly. A hero's work is never finished."

"Had you not told me that he..." A pause, punctuated by confusion on his features. Then it softened. "Ah... I see."

You sat up as he lowered himself to sit nearby. Even now his form towered above yours. A part of you felt it rather impressive. "Won't the city miss you if you're up here, Prince?" 

"I've done my part for tonight," he grinned toothily at you. "No one will mind if I vanish for a while to catch my breath."

You chuckled, and your gaze drifted up toward the Divine Beast again, it's gentle blue glow illuminating it's features. Neither of you spoke for a minute.

"Are you sure you would not celebrate with us, (Y/N)?"

"I'm sorry, Sidon, I just... I can't bring myself to answer the inevitable questions about Link's disappearance. Doubly so if people realise *I* was the one who calmed Vah Ruta."

"Are you sure?" Sidon seemed rather surprised, staring down at you.

"Sorry," you repeated. "I can't take that credit in his place."

Sidon held his stare for a few moments, then looked away towards the calm waters with a sigh. The silence that followed was one of concern - uncomfortable, thick with questions that the Zora prince wanted to ask. Finally he managed to get out: "You... Don't fancy yourself a hero, do you?"

Your head turned to face the Zora. "... Honestly, not really. It's not something I'd normally want to make a habit of."

"What would you be doing otherwise?"

"... Travelling, delivering mail, I suppose."

"Truly?!" Hearing this hero speak of such pedestrian things shocked the prince. "With such skill? Surely not!"

"I mean..." You thought for a moment as you decided how to explain the fact that you were transplanted from a combat-free life. "I never had to deal with hostility and evil like this before. When I came to Hyrule, well... that's the role that I took. I just wanted to travel the land. Sure, you deal with Bokoblins and Stalfos and that, but I knew that going in."

"So *why* would you then decide to continue the Champion Link's work? *How* were you able to then deal with our problem the way you did?"

"Because-- Because someone *had* to, Sidon." You took a breath. "If I didn't decide to at least try, then who would? Especially in the face of Calamity Ganon? I did this because with Link... gone, I couldn't just... just go about my time here knowing I was doomed. I had to do something."

Sidon nodded silently. He thought to himself as your head rested in your hands. It wasn't his fault that you had been in almost constant unknown territory since you came to in Hyrule. You had done much more than you had thought capable of yourself. You just wanted to rest, but you couldn't, not when this world needed its--

"You know, Hylian. Regardless of your thought on the matter, I believe that mindset makes you a hero."

Your jaw dropped, and your head snapped up to look at him. "But I-"

"In fact, you rather remind me of... of him. Of Link."

Whoa.

That was some real shit he just dropped on you.

"I... wow, Sidon, thank you. I never, *ever* thought I could be compared to him. I..."

You couldn't continue your sentence. You pulled your legs from the water, and stood, walking across to the other side of the dam, leaning against the railing, looking down at the gorgeous city below. Sidon turned to look at you in concern, and asked after a short moment, "I... have not offended you, have I?"

"No! No, no. God no." You glanced back at him. "Sidon, that was one of the nicest things I think anybody's ever said to me." You patted the railing next to you, and you heard him get up to join you once more. Once again there was silence between the two of you, but it felt more relaxed this time.

Though it had to be nearly midnight, the Domain below them was still brimming with activity. You allowed yourself a smile.


It was a few minutes of quiet before you got the courage to ask him the question that had formed at the front of your mind. "What was he like, Prince Sidon?"

"Hmm?"

"Link. You knew him, before all this, right?"
