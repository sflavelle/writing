----

Touching down outside the Hateno Ancient Tech Lab the next morning, you took a moment to gaze north. Though you could not see the Zora's Domain from here, you could spot the soft red glow of Vah Ruta's beam between the hills as it pointed toward the corrupted Hyrule Castle.

The enormity of what had transpired hit you rather suddenly.

That was *your* doing.

*You* had tamed the Divine Beast.

Beginner's luck? Perhaps...

Hopefully Link was recovering well.

Turning away, you stepped toward the doorway and knocked, before turning the handle and stepping in. "It's me," you called, smiling.

The inside of the Tech Lab was a mess of papers today. Director Purah was writing in her notepad when you arrived, and her eyes shot up to take you in. "(Y/N)!" She squealed, and started hurrying about the building, gathering books, bits and pieces. Symin, in the back, waved hello. "Just the person I was hoping for! So! Did the Sheikah Slate receive my message? How were the Zora? Did you do something about that Divine Beast?"

"Uhhh." You probably should have expected to be assaulted by so many questions. "Yes, better now, and... amazingly yes. Vah Ruta is saved from Ganon."

"OOOH! Excellent!" Purah rushed to lift something long from the table - heavy, it seemed, from how she was handling it - and pressed it into your hands such that your right hand automatically gripped the handle on the end. "Here, hold this for a sec. My sister was right to trust in you then."

"Well, I mean..."

"You know, at first I thought to myself, ' there's no way some stranger from another world could help us, post-Calamity.'" She started writing in her notepad again, looking you over.

"Gee, thanks," you laughed. "That's why I started by delivering mail. How would I know I was a half-decent fighter?"

"Modest as ever. But reading up on the ancient legends has opened my eyes to something I wasn't sure was possible. (Y/N), there is a theory written by the ancient Sheikah involving a Hylian princess, a hero, and a manifestation of evil?"

"How do you mean?" Your brows furrowed.

"They say that the princess of Hyrule is plagued by the Curse of Demise. That an entity called Ganon will manifest itself to shroud this world in darkness, and a hero will rise to stop him."

"Huh?" You found yourself pretending you didn't know of multiple games where exactly this was the case.

"It sounds crazy, doesn't it? But it's already happened, 10,000 years ago. And there are legends in Hyrule's vast history that would corroborate its truth. Books that, though their homes are long destroyed, have carried on to the present day."

Purah turned and started to rummage through a pile of books on her desk. "This one," she said, lifting one up to you, "is a supposedly fictional account about a boy who could travel through time to save his kingdom from a man named Ganondorf. And another," she discarded the first book to her desk and picked up another, "tells of a young man who tried to save his father, and ended up saving a princess and sent on a quest to prevent an evil beast from being summoned."

"So what are you saying about now? What am I holding, anyway?" You glanced down and noticed the unique handle... more of a hilt, actually. "Wait, isn't this-"

"The Master Sword, yes," Purah waved off the question.

"Wh- **Purah**!" You fumbled the sword briefly, before deciding to quickly set it down against a table. It was in its sheath, which seemed to be why you and Purah were able to hold it. "Can't this sword only be used by Link?!"

"So we thought," she replied with an odd look. "Look, (Y/N). I think that, though I'm sure these tales are embellished, they tell of past events. Almost all of them involving a princess, her hero, and a being of evil. I'm sure we're living through that curse right now."

"Why's that?"

"Because, (Y/N), neither side of that battle one hundred years ago has actually won yet. Link may have been on death's doorstep, but we acted quickly enough to save his life so that he could return and defeat Ganon. And Princess Zelda is of course still alive, in some fashion, holding the Calamity back from the untold destruction of our kingdom, waiting for him."

"But Link *is* gone now, isn't he? Surely he can't survive after how we found him." It hurt to say so...

"...It's possible. He will be a devastating loss to our kingdom. ...But then *you* come along. Fully formed, ready to help our kingdom, in one way or another. And despite your circumstances, *you* brave the wilds to help the people of Hyrule. *You* put yourself in danger to get Link's body to safety. And, amazingly, *you* manage to liberate a Divine Beast from Calamity Ganon, bringing us up to three of the four Divine Beasts back in our control."

She turned to face you. "(Y/N), I posit that either you are an awakening hero, or, considering the curse, a reincarnation of our hero Link."

The room was silent as you processed what was said. How can that be? You're not even a fighter in your world!

"...How do you figure that?" You asked slowly, skeptical.

"Simple." Purah smiled warmly up at you. "The Master Sword allowed you to hold it. It's said that that mystical blade can only be wielded by the person who is pure of courage." She paused, taking a breath. "Under normal circumstances, that is Link..."
