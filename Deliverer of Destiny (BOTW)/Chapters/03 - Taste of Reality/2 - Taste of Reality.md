"Thank you for your hospitality! I'll be sure to return soon!"

With those words to the innkeeper, and Uma's letter tucked safely in your new satchel, you set off out of the village, on your new adventure.

Heading west at first, along the path that should take you near the Duelling Peaks, then northeast into the narrow carved path which would lead toward Kakariko Village.

No doubt you would need to be careful - you reminded yourself as you descended into the patch of forest beneath the village that you would *eventually* run into monsters of some kind, something that would try to attack you and could not be reasoned with.

You hoped that your stamina and sprint would allow you to get away from any potential conflicts.

It was perhaps fitting that it was right here, as you exited Ginner Woods, finding yourself headed downhill, past where you first awoke here, that two red Bokoblins hiding in the taller grass got the jump on you.

You jumped back as they sprang out of hiding, doing... some sort of battle-cry at you, you guessed, and after a moment to collect yourself, you examined them and their weapons. One was holding a stolen pitchfork, aimed at you, and the other wielded a...mop broom. Huh. You gave yourself a bit more room - or attempted to, as you backed away, they moved in - and decided that if you could do something about the sharp weapon, the other would be less of an issue if you decided to leg it.

Again, you jumped back as suddenly the first Bokoblin thrust its pitchfork toward you, its buddy cheering it on. It came within a foot of you - man you were happy for your quick reactions here - and you got a good look of the rust and jagged shapes on the fork's points. *Fuck, yeah can't let /that/ touch me.* You thought you noticed the Bokoblin tip, as if it overextended? Hmm...

But it recovered after a moment, still holding its weapon, and you had to duck to dodge the mop head swinging at you. You pulled back further, on the edge of the wood again. You were starting to come up with a plan... if it worked, you might have yourself a weapon going forward.

You waited for the Bokoblin with the pitchfork to thrust at you again. When it did, you jumped back again to avoid its points, but then you came forward as it overextended again, and grasped the other end of the pitchfork, tugging it toward you. It worked - the monster crashed into the dirt, and though it held onto the weapon, you had wrenched it from its hands shortly after.

Reinvigorated with the feeling of a weapon in your hands, you arranged it in your hands so you could thrust back at them, ducking to avoid another swing at your head with the mop. You paused for a moment to consider what you were doing and then, with a deep breath, charged forward and impaled the second beast on the points of your fork. The poor thing screamed as four prongs pierced its chest, and as you pulled it back toward you it collapsed, its color quickly changing black before - *poof!* - bursting in a puff of Malice, leaving nothing but its weapon and various monster bits behind.

*...Holy shit.*

With the other monster getting to its feet, you decided the best course of action now was to make a run for it.

And so you did.

Charging down the slope, handling your new pitchfork like a soldier might carry their rifle, as you worked to put as much distance between you and your assailant as you could.

Thankfully, you were faster at running down the slope than the Bokoblins. Still, you put your head down at the split in the path, reducing the chance that more monsters might see you and give chase.

And then you were heading into the valley along the river, and it seemed like your attacker had given up, and after you crested the incline, and found yourself above the river, you allowed yourself an opportunity to pause and catch your breath.

...You were glad to be alive.

Of course it was either that, or dying a painful death to a weak monster... you decided to just take the win.

You gave yourself fifteen minutes to sit by the rock walls and catch your breath, and began to take stock of your body. You became aware of your shakiness, especially in your hands. The pounding of your heart against your chest.

The signs of fear.

Fear you hadn't felt in this way before.

...You were fearing for your life.

...Oh boy, you'd say coming to Hyrule was a mistake, but *that wasn't your choice to make*.

Once you had managed to calm yourself down, you stood, and stretched, and looked forward at the path to come.

The Cliffs of Quince.
