The morning found you upstairs in Hateno's inn, becoming aware of the early morning sun shining through the windows. 

You had only slept a few hours.

It wasn't that the inn beds weren't comfortable - for their time, they truly were - but you were used to your own bed, and the modern comforts of your time.

It would take some time to get used to, for sure.

Feeling slightly uneased by the nature of the inn, you rolled to your side and sat up, a yawn escaping you as you stretched your arms.
