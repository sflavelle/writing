The morning found you upstairs in the 'Great Ton Pu Inn', still in Hateno, becoming aware of the early morning sun shining through the windows. 

You had only slept a few hours.

It wasn't that the inn beds weren't comfortable - for their time, they truly were - but you were used to your own bed, and the modern comforts of your time.

It would take some time to get used to, for sure.

Feeling slightly uneased by the nature of the inn, the idea of someone walking in as they pleased, you rolled to your side and sat up, a yawn escaping you as you stretched your arms.

Looking about, you noticed only one other person up here amongst the few beds available - and it looked like they were getting ready to head off as well. They looked geared up for a long trek. You wondered if you knew this man...

You nodded politely as they looked up toward you. "Big day ahead?"

Your ears were immediately assaulted with the man's loud exclamations, full of energy in a way that almost insulted you. How could someone have such energy so early in the day? "That's right! Today, I, Worten of Hateno, will be beginning my expedition to the long-untouched province of Akkala! For I plan to be the first person in modern history to explore all the corners of Hyrule!"

*Ah. This guy.* "Oh yeah?" You responded, turning away to tie your shoes so the person didn't have to see you try and fail to hide your amusement. "I'm planning to do some travelling myself, actually. Any tips for me?"

"Of course! The most important of which being: 'Never give up'!"

You visibly struggled to stop yourself from making any sort of snorting or laughing noise.

He continued, not noticing, "The journeys ahead may be perilous, but you must have the willpower to go on, no matter what may stand in your way!"

This guy was going to be the end of you, and your journey had not even started yet.

Thankfully, you were shortly after saved by the sound of footsteps on the stairs, then the appearance of Prima the innkeeper. "Ah, thought I'd heard movement! Good morning!"

You wished you had been able to keep her from seeing your expression, the one of someone trying *very* hard not to laugh, but thankfully she seemed not to judge you or say anything. She continued, "I'll be serving up breakfast shortly. Would either of you care for some...?"

You nodded gratefully, taking the opportunity to catch your breath and force your expression back to normal. Worten, though... "Thank you Prima, but I must be off quite soon."

"Oh?" The kind woman raised an eyebrow. "Off to Akkala already?"

"That's right, Prima!" The man beamed behind you. "The province shan't stay largely unexplored forever!"

"Well I'm sure I don't need to remind you to stay safe and keep yourself fed!" Prima allowed herself a smile. "And pace yourself. Akkala will wait for you."

"Of course, ma'am!" With everything he had brought, the man was already making his way for the stairs. "Thank you once again for the hospitality, Prima. And to you for the conversation, er...?"

"I'm Y/N. It's been a pleasure, mister Worten." You'd managed to finally get yourself under control.

"Until next time then, Y/N!" he declared as he descended the stairs to leave the inn. "May we meet again on the road!"

And then he was gone.

Prima looked toward you, and raised an eyebrow.

All you could say was, "Please don't ask."

Breakfast in Hateno Village's inn consisted of wheat biscuits, lightly sprinkled with sugar, soaking in a milk bowl. Simple, but surprisingly delicious, Prima explained that the main ingredients were easily sourced from Hateno's own farming population - and the sugar cane bought from travelling merchants and processed locally. 

It was a small look into the economy of Hyrule, something you hadn't put serious thought into. From your time playing the game, of *course* travellers selling goods kept Hyrule going, especially after the Calamity - villages and communities would grow and breed what they could, but what they couldn't? Of *course* they'd need to trade with other villages.

Since Worten had already left, it was you and Prima out on the inn's balcony, and watching Hateno Village awaken. As the sleep ebbed away, cool air blowing through the hill, and the simple but tasty meal filling your stomach, you and the innkeeper chatted about your lives.
