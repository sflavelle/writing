The morning found you upstairs in Hateno's inn, becoming aware of the early morning sun shining through the windows. 

You had only slept a few hours.

It wasn't that the inn beds weren't comfortable - for their time, they truly were - but you were used to your own bed, and the modern comforts of your time.

It would take some time to get used to, for sure.

Feeling slightly uneased by the nature of the inn, the idea of someone walking in as they pleased, you rolled to your side and sat up, a yawn escaping you as you stretched your arms.

Looking about, you noticed only one other person up here amongst the few beds available - and it looked like they were getting ready to head off as well. They looked geared up for a long trek. You wondered if you knew this man...

You nodded politely as they looked up toward you. "Big day ahead?"
