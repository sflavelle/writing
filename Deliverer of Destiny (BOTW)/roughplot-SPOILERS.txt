You were killed on the night of your birthday, drunk, having stumbled into the path of an oncoming car. Waking up in the woods near Hateno Village, you have no idea where you are and why you seem to have been dumped in the forest, with no memory of your death.

You only realise where you are when you reach Hateno, and especially when you see Hyrule Castle, and two beams of light from the Gerudo Valley and Death Mountain holding the Calamity at bay. You realise that at least Link appears to be here and working, so you don't have to be a hero.

Realising that you're out of place and have no money, and wishing to explore Hyrule, you come up with the idea of delivering letters and goods for the people of Hyrule, making yourself an appropriate hat. Because you know it's dangerous, you also buy and train with a bow.

Your deliveries take you across the lands of Hyrule, and you're in awe of the places you once only saw on a screen. Though word travels of your work, you never interact with anyone 'plot-critical', aside from Kass the bard, who you often see at the stables you pass.

Your new life takes a drastic turn as, travelling in the Hebra region during a snowstorm, you stumble upon the dead body of Link, and realise you have to take on the hero's role after all. You deliver the news to Purah, delivering her Link's Master Sword and Sheikah Slate, and as you both use the Slate to return him to the Shrine of Resurrection, she realises that the Master Sword allowed you to hold it, and sends you off to Kakariko Village with a letter to Impa.

The two come to the conclusion that you might be a reincarnation of the Hero, and Purah theorises that perhaps your memory needs a jog. You're sent to recover one of Link's memories, to see if the theory is true.
