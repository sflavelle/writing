Snatcher's grip on her neck tightened, and he began to apply upward pressure. "*Don't make me show you just what happens to the contractors that disobey me,*" he warned. "*Show. Me.*"

The mental pressure on her thoughts increased again, and she started to falter. She was being choked, struggling to breathe in as a digit pressed upward against her chin, threatening to pop her head open like popping off the lid of some kind of drink...

"*Last chance, kiddo, before we say goodbye to that head of yours.*"

Alex opened her eyes, looking up into that manic grinning face.

And with a deep exhale, she slumped, and her defences vanished and--

He was back in that room. Viewing the world through her body and - more importantly - looking at the scene that he had been shown.

On the display was, it seemed, the fight he had had with Hat Kid in his domain. At the moment though,  neither of them were fighting. Hat Kid stood still, though occasionally bringing out toys from her pockets to play-fight and play-make-up with, or doing magic tricks with her hat, and the Snatcher on screen seemed content to just watch, as if he knew the kid was no longer a threat. Why didn't he just kill her, then?

Then he - they - glanced down at Alex's hands. She was holding a strange device with different buttons and knobs. Snatcher - the Snatcher temporarily looking through her memory - remembered what his minion had said about a device like this.

Almost in response to his unanswered question, Alex's thumbs began pulling the knob in a circular direction.

And on the display, Hat Kid started moving in a circular direction, running in the direction the thumb-knob pointed.

*Wait...*

Then the battle seemed to resume on the display, and then the pieces started to click into place.

One button would make her jump, and she would easily avoid his shockwaves, or the crowd of minions he'd summon. Another, and she would swing her umbrella at him when he tried confusing her with his apparitions, all the while moving in the directions that the thumb-knob pointed. 

*So... you were in control of the brat?*

A feeling of nervousness washed through the vision, an apparent confirmation of his theory. That would explain what she had meant earlier when forced to meet them. She had seen his world as a 'game', seemingly one where Hat Kid was the protagonist... yeah, that would track.

*So how did you come to us, then? What about Mustache, what's your connection...?*

In response, her memory, her mind flickered to the new scene. They were in the same room, but the display, instead of showing his domain, now saw the throne room of Mu's castle, with the tyrant herself standing right in front of her. He watched as, as if the display were just an open window, Mustache Girl had reached out *through the display* to snag the collar of Alex's shirt and pull her through- and suddenly the room surrounded them entirely, but the scene also became fuzzy, as if Alex didn't quite remember what had happened after that.

He relinquished his mental and physical grasp on her, and in his ethereal plane, he leaned back as Alex gasped for breath, clutching her head.
