The entity before them stopped. One of their eyes furrowed, seemingly trying to parse what Alex had just said to him.

Neither of them said a word.

Time passed uncomfortably by.

And then a sharp, intense pain as in an instant, Snatcher's ghostly hands sharpened into sharp claws and sliced effortlessly through their gut and throat. Blood splattered on the floor around her.

As he did, something peculiar happened.

There was a flash of a memory in his mind, one that was not his own.

*"What if... I give you your soul back? Will that make you go away?"*

*Snatcher instantly recognised the scene, the nervous tone in his own voice as the aftermath of his battle with the Hat Brat. But... this wasn't his point of view at all.*

*He found himself staring at the scene through a screen or window of some kind, where his words were also written out above his own form.*

*A twitch as the form he was currently occupying pressed a button on the device in their hands, and then the Snatcher-in-the-window continued, "Yes? No? Hello? Anybody in there?"*

Snatcher blinked, and he was back in his own ethereal plane, blood blossoming from the gaping wounds he had just given Alex.

Alex's body wavered uncertainly, then crashed to the ground, lifeless.

Snatcher lifted his hands up to his face, observed the dripping blood.

What had just happened?

It didn't seem that this human was magical in any way - or not in any way he could sense - so... how had she cast that memory upon him?

His minion appeared to be correct - she knew way more about things than she should. How on Earth had she been able to his dealings with the Kid so easily?

Snatcher surveyed the scene. "That's... *way* too much blood for a place like this," he muttered, sounding almost disappointed. "We've got standards to live up to on this planet, ya know."

How on Earth was she doing that, too? She was definitely deceased, so it was at least something she was not actively doing.

But usually, when he had to end a contractor, they just burst into a cloud of pons, health and their soul. The pons and health were of course useless to him, other than perhaps as a lure or 'carrot' for other contractors. Their body just poofed out of existence. So how was her body doing *this*?

That was going to have to be a mystery for later.

He sighed, and he left his ethereal plane, rematerialising in Subcon. Well, he was *not* going to deal with a contractor that talked back to him. He'll just have to go back to his minions and break the news that the well would have to wait.

As he passed through the forest, he wondered if he would have to lure someone to the forest to take care of the issues building around it. Surely-

A sense of something *alive* in front of him caught his attention. He passed his tree and paused, his thought process cut off.

On the ground, standing around looking around herself at the forest, was Alex.

The human who had *just* died by his hand. He glanced at his own claws, still bloody. Then back at Alex, who was pristine.

They looked terrified from a distance. Scared of the forest or scared of him? They let out a shriek when his claws wrapped around them and he pulled them back into his domain. 

As soon as he had let go of them, Alex snapped backward, wrapping her arms around herself. *As if that will save you,* Snatcher mused. "Look, okay. I'm sorry, I thought you might have found that funny," she explained.
