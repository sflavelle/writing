### Beware the Wanderer

"*Wait. You've* met *them?*"

"Yeah boss! I was in the room when everything happened!"

"*Were they dangerous?*"

"Well uh, they were taller than her, but they did a whole lot of getting beaten up if that answers your question. She thought they were with the kid."

It was the night after Snatcher's successful visit to the spaceship. Hat Kid was really set on going, as 'her job was done' - so he and his crew of Earth's Finest - and Cooking Cat - did have to resort to 'Plan B'.

Telling her that a *someone* from that day at Time's End was still among them.

They gave as good a description as they could, and the Kid reluctantly agreed to check them out, on the condition that she be allowed to leave once the person was found and appropriate action taken - whatever that might be.

Though he couldn't speak for the others, Snatcher had rounded up his minions the next day and told them about-- well, not quite everything, but the *gist* of everything. Explaining the confusion about 'time travel' chatter amongst some of the minions, and talking about the castle the 'hero' had summoned everyone to, judging them with her black and white tones of 'good and evil', and essentially killing them.

Then he talked to them about a kid with a hat - Hat Kid, the newbie, Kid, etc - who had made their way into the forest like any other sucker, been brought under his will through the contracts, and then... err, released in a gesture of good will! Yes, it can happen, sometimes! (*Minions in the know whispered the truth to their friends after he left.*)

That the Kid returned when it seemed like the planet was done for, and stood up for Subcon - and all of Earth - against the child tyrant, defeating her and restoring time such that the changes she made were undone.

Snatcher then explained that the Kid would likely not visit - unless her objective called for it - because she was on the hunt for a *human*.

He told his minions that this human would be about the same general shape as Hat Kid, only grown up - and finally asked that anyone who saw the human or had information on them was to come to him directly.

And sure enough, that evening, one of the minions sought him out, claiming to have been in the throne room of the tyrant's castle when they appeared.

"They were in this panel type of thing, and she was really upset that they were watching her. They were holding this... thing in their hands, pressing buttons on it."

"*Any idea what they were doing with it?*"

"None. It got left behind when they got pulled through, so I didn't get to see it after that."

"*Uh huh. It doesn't sound like they were working together.*"

"Yeah, I really don't think so, boss." The minion reached up to scratch the back of his hood. "In fact, I don't know if they're worth looking for, the impression I got is that they knew her, even if she didn't know them. I... think they might know more about things than they're letting on. The girl made some comment to me that this was all a game to them, and their reply was 'you have no idea' all smug-like."

"*What's all that supposed to mean?*"

The minion shrugged. "So *maaaybe* they know something? But really they're just nobody. I wouldn't worry about them, boss."

"*Good. That's good.*" Even so, Snatcher's claws rested just below his face, thinking. "*Perhaps we can put them to use, then.*"

"Boss?"

"*Well let's be honest with ourselves here, that hat kid won't fall for our traps a second time. Perhaps if we find the evil little girl we can put her into service. But the kid's leaving, and we have this stranger as a replacement. I think either way, we have a new towel boy. We just need to lure them to the forest.*"
