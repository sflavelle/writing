Contrary to his associates, DJ Grooves was looking at the human situation a little differently.

As he changed into cosier clothing for the night's rest, at home in his moon apartment, he considered what he knew of their mystery person.

From what he and the others had seen, they were similar in shape to the Kid, grown up. Her, but Mafia Boss-sized.

The other thing they knew, from having briefly seen them on the street, was that they didn't *appear* to be causing trouble - just trying to fit in. And surely the news would be circulating if they were causing mischief, making themselves known?

The thought occurred to him: perhaps they aren't from here at all. Perhaps that's why they stuck out to him and the odd crew he had made.

They must have made quite an impression to the red girl, if their first sighting of this person was them knocked out on the ground.

*That poor darling,* he thought to himself. *All alone, with no idea what's going on. I don't know their situation, but perhaps they just need guidance, someone to help them settle in.*

*I hope our diva can see that.*

Looking out his window at the Earth above, a rather impulsive idea came to him.

What if, once he finished editing his Bird Movie Award entry and submitted it, he celebrated by... taking a trip to Mafia Town to find her? Introduce himself, learn more about her...?

It wasn't like he was going to win the Award this year - it was the Conductor that would win this year. So why not 'treat himself' by going on an adventure of some kind? One that wasn't quite as dangerous as the one that had ended with him facing judgment.
