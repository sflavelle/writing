This was the third day that Alex had visited this Mafia Town bistro now.

They realised pretty quickly what they would be dealing with after the first day. Preferential treatment of Mafia first, long wait times, and barely edible food - but at least it *was* food. Barely.

It was the only place that sold meals that wasn't Mafia exclusive, though, so it would have to do.

While they waited, Alex tapped away at their phone, looking through the day's photography so far.

"Excuse me ma'am, have you been served yet?"

Alex looked up, surprised, not expecting a female voice. They had to look around for the source, and their eyes eventually landed on an orange cat in a chef's outfit.

*Wait, that's Cooking Cat*, they realised. They tried to keep your face from reacting, but Alex's eyes did widen in recognition. "Ah, no, not yet."

"Probably for the better, then. The Mafia's cooking is not worth the funeral." She shook her head. "Mind if I take a seat?"

"Not at all, though I fear I'll be fairly boring." Alex smiled, and laughed shyly. "I wish you'd told me that two days ago. It was the only food place I could find around here that would serve me."

"You poor dear. Well, I'd be happy to point you in the direction of some healthier eatin'." Cooking Cat smiled, and took a seat opposite Alex at the table, extending a paw. "I'm Cooking Cat, but people sometimes call me Cookie. Pleasure to meet you!"

Alex nodded, and extended their hand to shake Cookie's. "I'm Alex, happy to meet you." Raising an eyebrow, they added, "Something tells me this isn't a coincidence."

"Am I that obvious?" She laughed. "I mean, yes, but let's pretend it is for a moment."

Alex laughed too. "If you insist. Uh, how's the weather?"

Cookie giggled and responded with a similar question. "How's your family?"

"Looking forward to the weekend?"

Cookie snorted. "In seriousness though, how are you finding Mafia Town?"

Alex leaned back. "It's beautiful. I've never been to a coastal town quite like this in my
life. Great for photography... if you can ignore the Mafia graffiti."

"I suppose it *is* a coastal town... if the coast was in all directions." Cookie chuckled. "I've lived here all my life, and you're right. It was certainly much more lively and pretty before the Mafia arrived, but it's still retained some of its old charm in places. There's no place quite like this on the planet."

"Real shame, that." Alex sighed. "'Tis what it is, I suppose. I'm hoping to move on soon. Love the place, but... yeah, the hospitality has left something to be desired."

Cookie nodded. This 'Alex' person the others were so concerned about seemed relatively fine... she wondered what they saw in her, that she hadn't yet.

"Listen, Alex, dear." Cooking Cat leaned in. "Let me cut to the chase. I'm aware that you're an alien of some kind."

Alex flinched. "I, uh, I mean-"

"I think you should know... I've been privy to some recent discussions and, I'm not sure where you've come from but... you've picked up the attention of some... fairly powerful people on this planet. I would be *very* careful over the next few days where you travel and who you meet, lest you end up on the wrong side of a contract or blade."

Alex blinked. Powerful people? Contracts? Blades? What did Snatcher or the Conductor want with them? "Uh... what did I allegedly do?"

"I don't know. What I do understand, getting what information I can, is that a number of people experienced a, er, 'bad future' of sorts. Apparently there was a castle where people across the planet met their end thanks to some strange little girl. But a few people remember seeing *you* there, and I think they must be thinking that you're associated with her."

Wait, people thought they were in kahoots with Mustache Girl? "Uh... but I'm not. That little girl beat me up when she saw me. I'm just a regular kind person here."

"I can believe that, from having met you. But I'd still be careful, dear. If anyone asks you to come with them, I'd politely decline... except perhaps if it's an alien girl with a purple top hat, and perhaps DJ Grooves the film director. Anyone else... I'd watch out." Cooking Cat rested her paws in Alex's hands. "You've got this, Alex."

Alex's expression was blank as she processed what she was told. "I... thanks? How... should I get off this island, then?"

Cookie smiled. "Don't you worry. There's an underground rail station that connects to the greater Metro network, so you should be able to travel whereever you need from there. 'Course, the Mafia blocked it up with boulders some time ago, but looking at your stature, I think you won't have any trouble squeezing over the top. And hey! If you need to, the Metro itself is a nice place to lay low for a while. Just... be mindful you don't attract any unwelcome attention. It's not the sort of place you want to stay for too long."

Her eyes flicked up to something past Alex, and she straightened up. "Well! It's been a pleasure meetin' you Alex. I do hope we bump into each other soon." As she stood from her chair, she surreptitiously slipped something into Alex's pocket. "I hope you'll come by before you leave Mafia Town. I'd love to load you up with some *proper* meals for the road." With a smile, she turned and made to leave. "Til then, dear! Happy eatin'!"

Alex stared after Cooking Cat as she walked off, and nearly jumped as the clank of something being placed on her table surprised her. She turned back, and met the eyes of a Mafia Goon, who glared at her as he served her plate of what could best be described as 'slop'. Without a word, the Goon walked off to serve something much more edible to a group of other Mafia at the next table.

She stared down at the plate and no longer felt hungry.
