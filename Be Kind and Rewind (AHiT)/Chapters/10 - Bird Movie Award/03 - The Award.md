"...DJ Grooves!"

Grooves' jaw dropped, even as the crowd around him burst into applause and cheers.

He... *won?*

He wasn't *supposed* to win this year.

"WHADDA-*WHAT?!*" he heard from his competitor on the other side of the floor, and he glanced over, in disbelief. He saw that the Conductor was similarly flabbergasted, jaw open and almost frozen in place, gaping at the announcer and panel of judges on stage.

Next to him was the Kid. She was looking straight at Grooves from across the packed floor, giving him a *very* disapproving look that made him flinch away. The unasked question was very clear to Grooves. *Where's the Time Piece?*

DJ Grooves spread his flippers out, mouth still agape. Hoping to communicate that he had not taken one, even as he was ushered toward the stage.

As Grooves took center stage and he was handed the golden trophy and guided toward the microphone to say a few words, he was sure this had to be a dream of some kind.

He took a few deep breaths, calming himself, and launched into his unprepared speech.

----

After the award ceremony was over and the crowd of directors, movie buffs, reviewers and other staff were left to mingle, DJ Grooves approached the unoccupied judges' table, picking up a photocopy of their written remarks for the movies that had been sent in for Award consideration.

He had to know.

How could things have gone differently this time?

How had he *won*, by doing seemingly nothing differently-

"*YOU!*" A familar clawed hand grabbed his collar and yanked him backward, and he turned, brushing the hand away to come face to face with both Hat Kid and the Conductor. Neither were very pleased. "Where is it, peckneck?!"

"I-I didn't--" the DJ stuttered, trying to explain himself, but the other cut him off before he could even start.

"Ya musta done! Ye *know* I'm supposed to win this one!"

"I... I was just coming over to find out for myself." He gestured at the written review sheets. "I don't understand how-"

"Oh, but *ah* do," Conductor growled darkly, as Hat Kid took a sheet and read through it. "The allure of those *Time Pieces* was too great, weren't it? You went on just the other week about how dangerous they were, and yet *here you are*, caught red handed! How'd ya do it?"

Grooves stared him down. "I don't know."

"Don't be daft! How else could ye've--"

Hat Kid cleared her throat. Both directors looked over at her.

Having skipped to the finalists, she read aloud to the both of them, brows furrowed. "'While Murder on the Owl Express especially has excellent cinematography and storytelling, as expected from Conductor movies, the main character leaves something to be desired in their depiction. The acting is wooden and the delivery almost uncomfortably uninspired. Considering our first place entry uses the same actor, one wonders what tension behind the scenes may have hindered this movie.'"

She flinched, slightly offended by the criticism of her acting, then continued, skipping ahead. "'While Big Parade is a perhaps uninspired throwback to the age of movies without audio, of simple stories and experimentation with the medium, its execution is phenomenal. The joint movie debut of its lead actor, her cheer and enthusiasm as she leads her musical entourage through the city streets is infectious, and left our panel grinning ear to ear as she gradually ups the ante, bringing her parade from the streets to the rooftops and eventually to the air, showing her and her cast's range of movement as the musicians follow - still playing! This movie truly is a sight to be seen.'"

Both directors were silent for a few moments, before Conductor muttered 'gimme that' and snatched the paper from her to read. The Kid thought on the information they now had, trying to piece together what had changed in this timeline.

"...So yer mean to tell me," Conductor said slowly, quietly, a rage building in his chest as he continued to read, "that *you* cost me the Award, lass? Didn't ye tell us on yer ship that you didn't want to change-"

"Hey." Hat Kid glared at him. "I didn't change a *thing*."

Then it dawned on her.

"...*But*... neither of you could bribe me with the time pieces."

Conductor paused, halfway through reaching into his inner jacket pocket. "Eh?"

A memory flickered to the front of her mind, of when she had her first encounter with the directors. Little things seemed off, though, and she realised this memory was from *this* timeline. "...When Grooves hired me, he didn't even try to bribe me. Sure, he cheated in other ways--"

"Darlin'!" Grooves gasped.

"We *literally* faked a bird passport together!" the Kid cut him off. "But you weren't *forcing* me into anything, not really. *You*, however-" she spun round to Conductor. "You couldn't force me to be interested with a Time Piece, so I guess while I tried, I wasn't as invested in your movies."

DJ Grooves released a breath he didn't realise he was holding. "...So... I won because without the Time Pieces, I was still someone you... wanted to work with?"

"So it would seem." She nodded. "Sorry for doubting you, DJ."

Conductor sputtered, having read the full reviews. His hand still rested on the handle of the object inside his pocket. "But... but why would--"

Grooves turned to Conductor, seeing what he was about to pull out, but couldn't help but allow himself to be smug. "It's called being a good person Connie, you should try it some time."

Conductor froze, staring almost literal daggers at him.

...and after a few seconds, he pulled his hand back from his pocket empty-handed and, glaring at the both of them, turned and stomped out of the room.

Hat Kid and Grooves stared after him. "Uhhh," the Kid began.

"Oh, don't worry about him, darlin'. It's his second loss ever, by his own hand mind you, 'course he's gonna be butthurt. Er-" His eyes widened, and snapped toward the kid. "Pardon, darlin'. ...Prolly shouldn't be sayin' things like that in front of children."

For her part, Hat Kid shrugged. "So you really don't have a Time Piece on you?"

"Not unless you snuck one onto me, darling." He spread his arms out once more. "Search me if you must."

She shook her head. "I trust you. I just... didn't think that *not* losing Time Pieces over the planet would affect things like this."

"Yeah... huh."
