Closing the front door as quietly as she could, Mu turned to look at the house the interloper had chosen to hole up in.

The dim light of the moon through the windows illuminated a dusty floor. Though furniture from the last tenant still sat where they had lay for many years, most of the front room here was bare, ransacked when the Mafia first arrived. As she and Hat Kid silently stepped through, she could still make out the patches of floor that were less dusty - where years ago, chairs and couches and tables still sat.

The two paused as a light switched on in a room toward the back - not the house lighting, seemingly, but something smaller. The rustle of a paper bag followed. Mustache Girl thought for a moment, then turned to Hat Kid, gesturing at herself, then the doorway ahead, and then making a mouth shape with her hand and flapping it around. *I'm going to go talk to them.*

Hat Kid nodded slowly, mouthing her response. *Are you sure?*

Mu thought, her eyes pointed at the ceiling for a second, then nodded. She mouthed back, *be ready.*

Hat Kid's eyes narrowed toward the lit doorway, as she pulled the umbrella from her hip. With her other hand, she gave Mu a thumbs up.

Returning the gesture, Mustache Girl turned back toward the door and crept forward. The rustling had stopped, and now there were various eating noises emanating from the room.

What did this creature do in the shadows?

Mu reached the edge of the doorway, paused, took a breath, and stepped into the light.

Alex, the person she had pulled from another dimension, snapped around to look at her, breadcrumbs falling to the floor and onto the blanket they had wrapped around themselves. Their eyes showed fear, recognising the girl who had brought them here.

The light emanated from a flat rectangular device, revealing Alex and the bread bag she had taken, and casting the empty room around her in a cold, dim glow.

"You're... stealing bread from the Mafia?" Mu's expression faltered. This wasn't what she expected.

Alex's response was muffled as they finished chewing the slice of bread they had been eating. Swallowing, Alex repeated themselves. "I have no money."

Mu stared. She thought she was going into a hideout, about to face off with someone evil, the element of surprise hers. "...Who are you, anyway?"

Alex paused. There was the brief flicker of a smirk on their lips, amusement that they were only asking now, but it quickly vanished. She sat up and replied, "I'm Alex. I'm just a nobody from Earth. And before you ask, I didn't want to sleep outside and I didn't want to be harassed by Mafia in the night. So I found this empty unlocked house."

Mu furrowed a brow, stepping into the room and walking around Alex, turning her gaze away from the door. "But *this* is Earth. And I refuse to believe a person from another world who can turn invisible is just a 'nobody'."

"Look, I dunno what you saw, but I'm telling the truth, Mu."

"Well what are you doing here then?"

"... Are you serious? *You brought me here*. I thought I was gonna beat my game again, not have my game become sentient."

"No, I *found* you, I... wait, what are you talking about? How do you know my name?" Mu stepped forward.

"...Well, it's a long story, I- OW!" Alex flinched as an umbrella smacked into the side of their head with force, knocking them down.

Groaning and clutching their head, Alex turned their head to see what had struck them, and froze seeing Hat Kid standing over them, umbrella in hand.

Alex looked between them, realising that she was going to have to explain. "... Take a seat. I guess I have time."
