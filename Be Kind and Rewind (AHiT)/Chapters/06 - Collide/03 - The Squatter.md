Closing the front door as quietly as she could, Mu turned to look at the house the interloper had chosen to hole up in.

The dim light of the moon through the windows illuminated a dusty floor. Though furniture from the last tenant still sat where they had lay for many years, most of the front room here was bare, ransacked when the Mafia first arrived. As she and Hat Kid silently stepped through, she could still make out the patches of floor that were less dusty - where years ago, chairs and couches and tables still sat.

The two paused as a light switched on in a room toward the back - not the house lighting, seemingly, but something smaller. The rustle of a paper bag followed. Mustache Girl thought for a moment, then turned to Hat Kid, gesturing at herself, then the doorway ahead, and then making a mouth shape with her hand and flapping it around. *I'm going to go talk to them.*

Hat Kid nodded slowly, mouthing her response. *Are you sure?*

Mu thought, her eyes pointed at the ceiling for a second, then nodded. She mouthed back, *be ready.*

Hat Kid's eyes narrowed toward the lit doorway, as she pulled the umbrella from her hip. With her other hand, she gave Mu a thumbs up.

Returning the gesture, Mustache Girl turned back toward the door and crept forward. The rustling had stopped, and now there were various eating noises emanating from the room.
