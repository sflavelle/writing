The only warning that Alex got, mid-morning the next day, was the sound of hurried footsteps running up behind them.

Then somebody grabbed onto her arm, yanking it back, and suddenly she felt a great pain as Mustache Girl sank her teeth into her forearm.

Alex screamed in pain, flailing, trying to shake her off. "What the FUCK?! The fuck's *wrong* with you?!"

Whatever Mustache Girl said in reply was muffled by Alex's flesh. She bit down harder and Alex wailed again as she drew blood.

Alex, without thinking, turned toward a house on the side of the path and rammed herself into it, the wall smacking Mu in the back of the head, forcing her to let go.

She jumped back, clutching her bleeding arm. "The fuck's wrong with you?!"

"Disappear back to where you came from, already!" Mu snarled at her.

"I'm *trying*, asshole!"

The exchange had gotten a nearby Mafia Goon's attention. He walked with purpose up to them and snatched up Mustache Girl by her hood. "Little hooded girl shouldn't pick fights with defenseless ladies. Is Mafia job!"

In retaliation Mu swung around and punched him square in the side of the face. The goon dropped, and Mu was free again.

She whipped around to face Alex. She was *furious* - but Alex didn't understand what they had done to deserve this.

Mu launched at them again--

And the two were frozen in place, encased in an ethereal darkness.

Unable to move, the two's eyes flicked around, trying to find where it had come from.

And then Hat Kid strolled into view. She tutted disappointedly at them.
