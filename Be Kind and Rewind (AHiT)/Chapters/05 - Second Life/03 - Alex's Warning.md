This was the third day that Alex had visited this Mafia Town bistro now.

They realised pretty quickly what they would be dealing with it after the first day. Preferential treatment of Mafia first, long wait times, and barely edible food - but at least it *was* food. Barely.

It was the only place that sold meals that wasn't Mafia exclusive, though, so it would have to do.

While they waited, Alex tapped away at their phone, looking through the day's photography so far.

"Excuse me ma'am, have you been served yet?"

Alex looked up, surprised, not expecting a female voice. They had to look around for the source, and their eyes eventually landed on an orange cat in a chef's outfit.

*Wait, that's Cooking Cat*, you realised. You tried to keep your face from reacting, but your eyes did widen in recognition. "Ah, no, not yet."

"Probably for the better, then. The funeral is not worth eating the Mafia's cooking." She shook her head. "Mind if I take a seat?"

"Not at all, though I fear I'll be fairly boring." Alex smiled, and laughed shyly. "I wish you'd told me that two days ago. It was the only food place I could find around here."

"You poor dear. Well, I'd be happy to point you in the direction of some healthier eatin'." Cooking Cat smiled, and took a seat opposite Alex at the table, extending a paw. "I'm Cooking Cat, but people sometimes call me Cookie. Pleasure to meet you!"

Alex nodded, and extended their hand to shake Cookie's. "I'm Alex, happy to meet you." Raising an eyebrow, they added, "Something tells me this isn't a coincidence."

"Am I that obvious?" She laughed. "I mean, yes, but let's pretend it is for a moment."

...

"Listen, Alex, dear." Cooking Cat leaned in. "I'm not entirely sure what's going on, but you ought to know that you've picked up the attention of some... fairly powerful people on this planet. I would be *very* careful over the next few days, lest you end up on the wrong side of a contract or blade."

Alex blinked. Powerful people? Contracts? Blades? What did Snatcher or the Conductor want with them? "Uh... what did I allegedly do?"

"I don't know. What I do understand, getting what information I can, is that a number of people experienced a, er, 'bad future' of sorts. Apparently there was a castle where people across the planet met their end thanks to some strange little girl. But a few people remember seeing *you* there, and I think they must be thinking that you're associated with her."

Wait, people thought they were in kahoots with Mustache Girl? "Uh... but I'm not. That little girl beat me up when she saw me. I'm just a regular kind person here."

"I can believe that, from having met you. But I'd still be careful, dear. If anyone asks you to come with them, I'd politely decline... except perhaps if it's the alien girl with her spaceship, and perhaps DJ Grooves the film director. Anyone else... I'd watch out." Cooking Cat rested her paws on Alex's hands. "You've got this, Alex."
