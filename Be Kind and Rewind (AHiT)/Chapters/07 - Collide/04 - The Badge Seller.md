"Perhaps I might shed some light on your situation," said an odd voice from the doorway.

The three of them turned.

His limbs flickering and twitching, the entity clothed in red, staring at them through a creepy painted mask was instantly recognisable to Hat Kid and Alex, who flinched away at the dimly lit figure of the Badge Seller in the doorway. In person he was much creepier than Alex expected.

Hat Kid greeted him happily with a wave. "Hi, Badge Seller!" she called cheerfully.

Mustache Girl, however, pointed at him and screamed. "W-what kind of *thing* are you?! You must be working with her! Why else would--"

"Hey!" called a muffled Mafia voice from the other side of the wall, from the next apartment over. "Mafia trying to sleep here. Keep quiet!"

Alex froze.

Everyone stayed silent for a few moments, the three humans staring at the wall. Thankfully the goon did not continue to argue.

Hat Kid spoke up, making sure to keep her voice down. "No, they're my friend, Mu."

"Of *course* they are." Mustache Girl thankfully lowered her voice.

"You may refer to me as the Badge Seller, young one." The mask twitched slightly toward Hat Kid. "May I take a seat?"

"Please!" she responded with a beaming smile.

He used his staff to carefully lower himself to the ground, sitting cross-legged on the ground opposite Alex. "I have been watching your adventure in this world with some interest, young Alex."

Alex looked to him, saw his mask flicker upside-down, revealing... *nothing* behind it, which made her flinch and gulp. "I uh... I guessed you might."

"You have done rather well to make the best of your unique situation."

"The... best?" She gestured at the room around them.

"What do you make of Alex's story?" Hat Kid interrupted.

"She's totally lying, right?" Mu added. "There's *no way* there could be a game about *her* and not *me*."

Hat Kid looked over at her with a raised eyebrow. Mu responded with a grin and a wink. Hat smiled, understanding that she was making a lighthearted joke.

"In this universe, you're right," Badge Seller nodded. "There isn't such a video game. But in Alex's reality, there does indeed exist a game called 'A Hat in Time', starring our young Time expert here," he gestured toward Hat Kid, "and featuring you, young one; myself; and a number of others from across this planet."

There was a brief moment of silence as the others took this in.

"Soo.... if... this is a video game..." Mu began.

"On the contrary, this is very much reality," the entity countered.

"But you just said--"

"Allow me to explain. Let us say, to make an example, that each of us is a self-contained universe." He rested a glitchy hand over where his heart should be. "We each have our own laws that govern us, that tell us how things should act, that determine what is possible. We all have our own goings on, our own adventures. But, our universes do not exist in a vacuum."

He spread his arms wide. "Our universes leave marks on each other all the time, young ones. But the signs are hard to find if you don't know what you are looking for."

Hat Kid raised a hand. "What... *are* we looking for?"

"*Everything.* Video games, books, movies, musicals, sonnets. What I have learned from my journeys is that creativity is the birthplace of not just art, but entire universes - and that sometimes, that idea swimming in your thoughts is another universe waiting to make its mark through you."

He gestured toward Alex. "Alex experienced this universe as a video game because that's the way *your* universe left its mark on *hers*. But clearly this universe is not *just* a video game - it began long, long before she started playing, and will end long, long after she does. If it were, then perhaps you wouldn't know what Seaside was like *before* it was renamed Mafia Town," his outstretched arm moved to gesture at Mu. Then he gestured toward Hat Kid. "And you might not understand *why* you were a space traveller, trying to get home."

"Whoaaaa..." Hat Kid was in awe. One could almost see stars in her eyes.

Mu was silent, mouth gently hanging open as she stared at the Badge Seller. A few long moments passed before she finally asked, "Are you... a god or something? How do you know all this?"

Badge Seller's laughter was warm and vibrant as his belly(?) shook, holding an arm against it to keep himself together. "No, no, young one, though I appreciate the compliment." He settled down after a moment. "No, I simply have lived far too long, and have seen far more than perhaps one should. There is a reason why my form is... well, the way that it is." He glanced upward. "I became unmoored from my original universe a very long time ago, and I've become quite accustomed to travelling the multiverse."

"So... why does she look like *that*, then?" Mu jerked a thumb at Alex.

"Hey!"

"'Hey' what? I mean you always kinda look like you've just been stitched into the picture, your edges are a bit..." She waved her hand in circles as she stalled for an appropriate word. "...fuzzy, in a sense."

"Hmm, well, I have a theory, but it's untested," Badge Seller admitted.

"*Untested*?" Mu slowly repeated.

"That's... kind of terrifying, coming from you," Hat Kid thought aloud.

"Please understand, young ones - in all my time travelling, I have not seen this phenomena before. But my theory is this: That her reality and your own disagree with each other fundamentally. Currently, she is being governed by her own reality's rules."

"Let me explain with another example." His head turned toward Hat Kid and Mu. "Young ones, if I were to scratch you with something, what would happen?"

"We'd... take damage," Hat Kid answered with a raised eyebrow.

Badge Seller nodded. He then turned to Alex. "What would happen to you, if I were to do the same?"

Alex felt all three sets of eyes land on her. "I'd probably start bleeding?" she offered.

"Exactly." He clapped his hands together. "Your universes deal with injury in very different ways, such that they can be rendered incompatible with each other." He turned to Alex once more. "Here's another example, one perhaps more pertinent. From what you understand, does your universe allow for time travel?"

She shook her head. "We like to think it possible, but I personally don't see how."

"Another fundamental difference. Whereas Time itself is more malleable in this universe, in Alex's it is very rigid."

"Wait, so..." Hat Kid's eyes widened. "When I fixed the big time rift, it didn't send her back to her world because Time... *can't* go backwards there?"

Badge Seller nodded. "I believe this is where her current state originated from. For most intents and purposes, this universe can't conform Alex to its physics and laws, because it already passed her off back to her universe. *This* universe believes Alex is in *her* universe."
