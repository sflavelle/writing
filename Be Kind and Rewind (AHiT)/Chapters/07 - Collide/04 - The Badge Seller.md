"Perhaps I might shed some light on your situation," said an odd voice from the doorway.

The three of them turned.

His limbs flickering and twitching, the entity clothed in red, staring at them through a creepy painted mask was instantly recognisable to Hat Kid and Alex, who flinched away at the dimly lit figure of the Badge Seller in the doorway. In person he was much creepier than Alex expected.

Hat Kid greeted him happily with a wave. "Hi, Badge Seller!" she called cheerfully.

Mustache Girl, however, pointed at him and screamed. "W-what kind of *thing* are you?! You must be working with her! Why else would--"

"Hey!" called a muffled Mafia voice from the other side of the wall, from the next apartment over. "Mafia trying to sleep here. Keep quiet!"

Alex froze.

Everyone stayed silent for a few moments. Thankfully the goon did not continue to argue.

Hat Kid spoke up, making sure to keep her voice down. "No, they're my friend, Mu."

"Of *course* they are." Mustache Girl thankfully lowered her voice.

"You may refer to me as the Badge Seller, young one." The mask twitched slightly toward Hat Kid. "May I take a seat?"

"Please!" she responded with a beaming smile.

He used his staff to carefully lower himself to the ground, sitting cross-legged on the ground opposite Alex. "I have been watching your adventure in this world with some interest, young Alex."
