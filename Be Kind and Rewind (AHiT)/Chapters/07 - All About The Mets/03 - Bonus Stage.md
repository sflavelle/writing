At one stop, Alex witnessed a conversation between two apparent cat workers. Two boarded through the door nearest Alex, both dressed for the office, one with glasses, and sat next to each other. As they came in, the coworker was saying to his glasses friend, "...so you have to go back to them in a week. But you can't do jack! 'Cause they're, y'know, tied! To the Mafia!"

Glasses was busy looking at his phone to seemingly reply. Coworker covered the phone with his paw. "I *know* this fascinates you, you... fascinator."

Glasses sighed and looked up. "You don't have a car."

"I have a car! I bought it! A-and you can't drive it! It's expensive. And it- and it's from the Union."
