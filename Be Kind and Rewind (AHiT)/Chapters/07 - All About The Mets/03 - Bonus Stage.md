At one stop, Alex witnessed a conversation between two apparent cat workers. Two boarded through the door nearest Alex, both dressed for the office, one with glasses, and sat next to each other. As they came in, the coworker was saying to his glasses friend, "...so you have to go back to them in a week. But you can't do jack! 'Cause they're, y'know, tied! To the Mafia!"

Glasses was seemingly too busy looking at his phone to reply. Coworker covered the phone with his paw. "I *know* this fascinates you, you... fascinator."

Alex's eyes snapped up. 

Glasses sighed and looked up. "You don't have a car."

"I have a car! I bought it! A-and you can't drive it! It's expensive. And it- and it's from the Union." Coworker fished a phone from his pocket, searched for something on it and showed Glasses.

Glasses stared at it for a few moments. Blinked, then again. Finally he said, "Yyyeaaah, that's a box."

Alex found herself silently mouthing Coworker's response in sync with him: "It is *now*, thanks to my mechanic Brad! Whom I shall now call, 'Brad the Bad... Guy.'"

What on Earth was going on here? They were just, word for word reciting an internet cartoon from Alex's world.

She looked away and back to the window outside as the train drew closer to the Metro hub, still mouthing the lines to an episode these cats couldn't possibly have known.
