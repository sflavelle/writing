### All About The Mets

"Mafia Town...? But why, boss?" The moon penguin raised an eyebrow over their sunglasses. "You know the reputation."

"I do, I do," DJ Grooves nodded, addressing his actors at the wrap-up gathering. It was a tradition he liked to uphold, a small party at the studio, to show his crew he appreciated their efforts. "But in spite of those brutes that run the place, it's a beautiful place I've only ever visited on work business. I would love to soak in the sun and surf just once in my life, darlings."

"Is it to do with you losing this year?" chirped up another.

The question made him flinch. *Right, of course, the results were foregone especially this year... But to hear his penguins say it hurt.* "Er... perhaps. Look, to summarize my... complicated thoughts on the whole situation, I think we smashed this movie out of the park on this one, no matter what the judges say, and we *all* should take time to pat ourselves on the back, as it were."

So it was that he was able to reassure his staff that he was fine, and he had accepted the upcoming loss, *this time*.

Waving off the last few penguins with a "until next season, darlings!", Grooves locked the doors into his studio, a small messenger bag of supplies from his office at his side. The foyer was quiet, even though it was midday.

*The owls must be on their lunch break*, he thought to himself.

He paused briefly, at the door out to the parking lot, to glance around the lobby. The posters, standees, his trophy cabinet.

*...Til next year.*
