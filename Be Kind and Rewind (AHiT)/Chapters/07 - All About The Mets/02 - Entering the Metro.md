Getting into the tunnels of Mafia Town was perhaps more troublesome than Cookie had made it out to be.

The next evening, weighed down with a new bag full of precooked meals, Alex set off from the abandoned, ransacked apartment she had called her own for the past couple of days, and travelled around the small island over to the town plaza, where the bazaar was just a flight of stairs away.

Once there, she'd descended the steps and then went up a smaller set of steps that led into the Bazaar itself - a series of stalls where the Mafia sold things to each other... mostly fish. And down the other end of the Bazaar, overlooking the beach, was the entrance to the tunnels, and hence the way into the planet-wide Metro.

Somewhere, deep in the depths of the place, was the central hub of the Metro, teeming with cat life... and the leader of a laundering and heisting ring. Hopefully she would never have to cross them.

But first Alex had had to deal with getting in in the first place. As part of closing off Mafia Town to visitors, goons had long ago blocked the entrance with boulders and rocks.
