Getting into the tunnels of Mafia Town was perhaps more troublesome than Cookie had made it out to be.

The next evening, weighed down with a new bag full of precooked meals, Alex set off from the abandoned, ransacked apartment she had called her own for the past couple of days, and travelled around the small island over to the town plaza, where the bazaar was just a flight of stairs away.

Once there, she'd descended the steps and then went up a smaller set of steps that led into the Bazaar itself - a series of stalls where the Mafia sold things to each other... mostly fish. And down the other end of the Bazaar, overlooking the beach, was the entrance to the tunnels, and hence the way into the planet-wide Metro.

Somewhere, deep in the depths of the place, was the central hub of the Metro, teeming with cat life... and the leader of a laundering and heisting ring. Hopefully she would never have to cross them.

But first Alex had had to deal with getting in in the first place. As part of closing off Mafia Town to visitors, goons had long ago blocked the entrance with boulders and rocks. Whereas Cookie had implied some sort of gap where she could squeeze through, that didn't actually seem to be the case.
That said, after some experimentation (and help from nearby Mafia who were eager to see the non-Mafia girl 'get lost'), she found that some of the rocks were light enough for her to pull or lift away, revealing a gap she could crawl through... and that the Mafia could promptly fill back up once she was through.

Perhaps unsurprising was the lack of light in the tunnels. The few specks of light that streamed in through gaps in the rock blockade were enough to get her down the stairs into the heart of the tunnels, but after that, Alex was reduced to feeling her way through, keeping a hand to the left-hand wall and following whereever it may lead.

The surface of the walls reminded her of what she might find in an underground station - bricks, but those polished ones, usually in white or some other refined color. The sound of tiled floor beneath her gave the same impression. She still found it hard to believe that Mafia Town was connected to the Metro... or at least used to be.

But indeed, after a few minutes of feeling her way around, the tunnels began to lighten up again, and soon she found her way to a station platform.

The Mafia Town Station was a small platform built under the town, with a window set into the opposite end that gave a view of the underground well of water that supplied the town. Or maybe it was the ocean she was seeing... Alex couldn't quite tell if her travels had led her off from under the island.

To her left was a signpost, seemingly left by a Metro authority. Half of it was written in the cat language, but underneath was seemingly an English translation:

```
Due to actions of the Mafia Town authorities,
No trains stop automatically at this station.

To board from this station, please use the
nearby button to signal the next train to
stop here.

Regards,
Metro Staff
```

Indeed, next to the sign was a button on a stand. Pressing it--

There was a rumble in the tunnels behind her, and Alex thought she heard an explosion in the distance. She turned her head back toward the tunnel. What was going on out there?

Looking back, she saw a red light had lit up at the far end of the station. Now she just had to wait.

"Are you sure this is where she went?" Hat Kid asked her hooded companion as the two walked through the dark tunnels, a few minutes behind. In lieu of her umbrella, she held a flashlight out, illuminating the way for them.

"Positive," Mustache Girl said confidently. "Those Mafia we beat up just blocked the way in. Again."

"And... why'd they do that?" Kid raised an eyebrow.
