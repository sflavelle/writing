Alex found herself in a world of white.

A plane of nothingness, where the ground she walked on, while solid, felt like nothing beneath her feet.

There was no sound other than the rustling of her clothing as she walked, no smell but her body odours.

Occasionally small bumps or rocks would appear in the path she took, polygonal and as white as the world around them. The small shadows they cast around itself and the world reminded Alex of a debug world of sorts - as if someone had disabled all the textures and simply ran an ambient occlusion shader.

But the plane seemed infinite, the line between ground and 'sky' blurring into nothing, the further away she looked.

Her immediate thoughts were that she would simply be stuck here for eternity.

She couldn't even really describe what 'here' was. Was she in a different plane of sorts in the same reality? Was she in a different universe altogether? *Was* this part of a universe?

This was all too much for her.

She kept walking.

As she walked, the white around her, having struck her as being a similar 'matte white' as in Smash Brawl promo material, started to dim, growing orange before fading into a dark gray, as if the sun was setting, somewhere. How, Alex had no idea.

As the 'night' fell, she started to notice a sort of 'fog' around her, closing in on her it felt, bleeding the remaining light into pitch darkness the further out she looked.

If this was going to be the remainder of her life, she was not too thrilled about the prospect.

She kept walking.

After another hour or so, the terrain was starting to change. Around her, tall, great trees grew from the ground, and seemed to suggest a path that she was walking on.

Perhaps she could make a home of some kind here?

Assuming nothing *else* lived in this space between worlds.

Eventually her fears seemed to be confirmed, as she became aware of a flickering orange light becoming visible through the trees. *A fire*. It was the first color she had seen in ages now. It cast its light on the trees around her, coating them in its yellow-orange glow, its shadows dancing around her.

She slowed herself, stepping carefully around the next turn of the path, in case she had to run.

... It was a campsite.

And the Badge Seller was there, perched on a log bench, roasting marshmallows. His red and purple colors stood starkly from the plain shades of gray around him.

He looked up toward her, seeing her peeking her head out from behind the featureless tree. "Ah, there you are. I was growing concerned that I'd need to venture out into the Horizon to find you."

Alex blinked. "The... Horizon? Is that what this all is?"

"Indeed. The Horizon is not a dangerous place, not anymore - but one can very easily become lost. I apologise - I had not truly considered what 'in between' could imply in regards to your situation." The Badge Seller gestured to a seat opposite him. "Please, take a seat."

Alex slowly entered into the clearing, looking around herself. The campsite clearing was surrounded by fencing, with the massive trees on either side. There seemed to be an entrance on the opposite side, leading somewhere else. And something about this area reminded her of somewhere, but she couldn't quite place her finger on what... she lowered herself onto the other log bench. 

As she sat, the Badge Seller gestured toward the roasted marshmallows cooking over the fire. "Feel free to help yourself. You need the sustenance more than I do, after all."

She nodded, mumbled a quick 'thank you' and took one of the sticks of cooking marshmallow. After eating one, soothing the growing hunger pains, she took a few breaths of the sterile air. "I've... heard of the Horizon... or at least I think I have. Only in, uhm... fanfiction though." Her voice dropped to a mutter for the last part.

For his part, he chuckled. "Well, I *did* say there was a universe for everything. Branching paths, alternate realities... they are universes all the same." He paused for a moment, gazing upward. "This is the *true* Horizon. This... this is the plane where I came to be. I was something... else back then, of course. This universe was once much more alive, and this forest with it. Ah... but it was not meant to be, I suppose."

His gaze dropped back down to Alex. "This place will not harm you while you are here. I am happy to return you to your previous location once you are ready." He stoked the campfire carefully, watching wisps of embers float up into the air. "I suspect that you have questions, on all that I have told you. But let us start with a question of my own - is the badge I have given satisfactory?"

Alex nodded. "I didn't realise just how much i was missing being able the feel the textures of everything. Feeling the temperature, the wind - Not that there's much of anything *here*... But especially the food." She chuckled. "That said, since it is a badge, I guess I should ask... what would happen if I took it off?"

"At this stage, you would return to your 'inbetween' state, following the rules and laws of your universe. But, thankfully, that would be that. Still not ideal, but by wearing it at all, you've fixed many of the remaining issues with multiversal travel."
