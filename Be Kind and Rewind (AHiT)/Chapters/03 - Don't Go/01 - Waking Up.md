### The Earth Alliance

It was a cool breeze gently blowing past that caused Alex to stir.

Coming to consciousness, their first thought was, *how did I make it to bed?*

It wasn't the most comfortable she'd been, but it was probably something to do with how she'd forgotten the end of the previous night. And that strange dream she had...

They felt the breeze again and shivered. In a groggy voice, they called to their smartphone, "Siri, turn off the tower fan."

"Mafia is not Siri."

Alex shot up, their eyes slamming open.

And was immediately face to face with one of the Mafia Goons. "Mafia is Mafia," he continued, amused at their reaction. "Young lady look like she saw ghost."

Alex looked around. They had been laying in a corner of the sidewalk that seemed to be used for disposing of garbage. They quickly got to their feet as she realised their 'bed' had been bags of garbage beneath them, eliciting a chuckle from the goon who had found them.

A tarpaulin sheet that had been draped over the area had a hole torn it above where they had lain. Had they made that?

*Oh.*

Now Alex remembered this area. As if they needed confirmation.

This was Mafia Town.

*...last night's 'dream' was not a dream.*

But even so, how had they ended up here?

"How did young lady get here? Tourism board currently closed."

Alex cleared their throat, turning to him. "...That is a *very* good question." They stepped out from beneath the tarp into the sunlight, covering their eyes as they looked around. They noticed the expression of confusion on the Mafia goon's face and added, "I don't know how I got *here*, really."

"Little lady is strange."

"I'm sure I am." They nodded. Then, slightly overwhelmed by the realizations, they walked down the path away from the Mafia goon, gazing around at the world they'd only previously seen through a screen.

Why were they here?

There was... whatever happened before with Mustache Girl, but how had she gone from that to... this?

Alex's gawking led them over two bridges and into a street where many units and apartments packed against each other. The sea breeze blowing through was refreshing, but the smell of coal and smoke from the industrial area of the island was not. It was a reminder that the Mafia weren't native here.
