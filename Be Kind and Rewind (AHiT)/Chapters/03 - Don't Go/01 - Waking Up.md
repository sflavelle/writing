### The Earth Alliance

It was a cool breeze gently blowing past that caused Alex to stir.

Coming to consciousness, their first thought was, *how did I make it to bed?*

It wasn't the most comfortable she'd been, but it was probably something to do with how she'd forgotten the end of the previous night. And that strange dream she had...

They felt the breeze again, and shivered. In a groggy voice, they called to their smartphone, "Siri, turn off the tower fan."

"Mafia is not Siri."

Alex shot up, their eyes slamming open.

And was immediately face to face with one of the Mafia Goons. "Mafia is Mafia," he continued, amused at her reaction. "Young lady look like she saw ghost."

She looked around. She had been laying in a corner of the sidewalk that seemed to be used for disposing of garbage. She quickly got to her feet as she realised her 'bed' had been bags of garbage beneath her, eliciting a chuckle from the goon who had found her.

A tarp that had been draped over the area had a hole torn it above where she had lain. Had she made that?

*Oh.*

Now she remembered this area. As if she needed confirmation.

This was Mafia Town.

*...last night's 'dream' was not a dream.*

But even so, how had she ended up here?

"How did young lady get here? Tourism board currently closed."

Alex cleared her throat, turning to him. "...That is a *very* good question."
