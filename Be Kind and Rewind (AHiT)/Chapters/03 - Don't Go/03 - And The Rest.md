The Mafia Boss of Cooks was not expecting visitors from out of town. 

Many Mafia acted as if he hadn't lost his body in the first place. While he had not been fond of the experience, it struck him as odd, that only a small number of his crew truly remembered what he realised was now a past version of events, while he got to remember the period where he was a pair of eyes and a moustache floating in liquefied ... he didn't care to think about that too much.

So when several Mafia burst into his theatre yelling about ghosts, it took him a bit longer than he would have liked to realise that the Snatcher was involved. Having traveled around the world (and on that meddlesome kid's spaceship), he should have known that only one supernatural entity ventures so far out from the Subcon Forest.

And so, when the ghost indeed appeared before him, casually floating in through the doors (and promptly scaring off the mafia guarding them), the Mafia Boss was amused. "The Subcon Snatcher graces me with his presence! To what do I owe this unexpected surprise?"

"*Always straight to business with you, huh?*" The Snatcher grinned. "*I'll make this quick.*"

With a snap of his fingers the contract appeared before the Mafia Boss. "*That kid with the hat is planning to leave Earth, and I wondered if you, like me, have any objections with the idea.*"

"Of course I do!" Was the Boss's response. "She is rude and has no respect! But she is a damn good fighter, and I'll be damned if she leaves us on some flight of fancy!"

"*She wants to go home.*"

"Details! I will sign."

"*Good choice, my friend.*"

"Excuse me, mister Snatcher sir?"

Snatcher paused on his way descending from the casino. A small feminine voice had reached him. Not the Kid's, but... the Mafia didn't employ kids *or* women. So who...?

"Psst, over to your left."

His head turned toward a balcony.

There it was. It was a cat, but... it wore a cook's outfit. Who...? "I don't suppose I could, speak with you privately?"

Snatcher raised an eyebrow. He slowly drew closer, his fuzz a deep black. As he approached the cat, it was as if the light was being drained from the world, leaving his glowing yellow features the only light.

Then, out of nowhere, lightning struck in the distance, and the world lit up again, finding them in a purple 'void', lined with dead trees.

The Snatcher towered over the animal. In a low voice, he spoke, "*You must be either very brave or very foolish to seek audience with me. Which is it?*"

"Why, you are *just* as spooky as the legends say!" The cat beamed up at him. "Pleasure to make your acquaintance. I am Cooking Cat, TV chef extraordinaire! There's word among the Mafia you're trying to get the alien to stay."

Snatcher stared at her. "*What's a 'TV'? No, hang on - they're blabbing* already? *I just got out of there!*"

She shrugged. "You should know that I've been investigating that alien and her spaceship for a few days, and if you'll have me, I may be able to help appeal to her."

Snatcher stared at the creature. His first instinct told him to silence it permanently and devour its soul but this... 'Cooking Cat' might know how to convince the kid to hang around, if she's been on her ship.

... oh, he hoped this wouldn't be taken for weakness... "*Today's your lucky day, cat. You have sixty seconds. Explain why you can get her to stay and why I shouldn't have your soul as a snack.*"

Next to him, a giant stopwatch puffed into existence, winding itself up to one minute before Snatcher smacked the start button with his hand.

Cooking Cat, seeing this, blanched slightly - eliciting a smirk from the entity - and took a breath. "I met her up there, in the Mafia headquarters. She was nice enough, asked to borrow a bucket of crabs I was going to be cooking to get a key, or something like that. She struck me as strange, and would you believe my surprise when I track her down to a spaceship in the sky?

"Anyhow, I've noticed she has two weaknesses, food and knick-knacks."

"*What knick-knacks are we talking here?*"

"Gimmicky stuff. Gift shop stuff. I gave her the other half to a burger cushion set she had, and I saw her after that trying to put together a miniature train set. She seemed really excited about collecting things like that from Earth before she left."

"*Ah, the joys of being a kid.*" Snatcher filed the information away in 'potential blackmail material'. "*And the food situation?*"

"Well, she's been eager to try different foods from here as well, so I *was* cooking for her for a while. Probably a good thing, I'm not sure anything in her refrigerator was edible. Pretty sure there was a sandwich in there that was alive."

"*So you've been on board her ship for the last week or so then?*"

"A few days, mister Snatcher."

"*I've never seen you when I've visited.*"

"I may have been *mostly* investigating the alien kitchens."

"*Ooooof course you were. Also, only a couple days?*"

"It's the strangest thing! I decided to come on before she left Mafia Town. She said she was going to do some movies for the birds at Dead Bird Studios and said she'd be here a while, but then next thing I know, she says she's finished and was leaving tonight, and where could she drop me off?"

Snatcher thought a moment. Interesting... this cat didn't mention Lava World at all. Compared to the few he'd talked to in the past 24 hours, it seemed Cooking Cat might have no idea about the future that had already occurred and been subsequently erased. "*Weeell... I wouldn't normally do this, but okay.*" With a snap of his claws, the stopwatch vanished. He was convinced. "*Myself, the Boss and the two directors of Dead Bird Studios are going up there tomorrow night to convince her to stay. I can bring you along, but I'll have to get you to sign something, and it's only because of a trait I know the Kid'll adore.*"

"Of course! What do you mean?"

"*You're disgustingly...* adorable, *and you have fur. She'll love that.*"

"You flatter me, mister Snatcher!"

"*Don't get too comfortable with me.*" The contract appeared again, with quill. "*If you accept what you'll be getting into, just add your signature.*"

"Absolutely!" She read briefly through the contract, noting the creature's impatience and commenting with a light smile, "Your reputation precedes you, I wouldn't be doing my due diligence if I didn't see what I was signing." She nodded as she finished reading, and took the quill in her paws to scribble her signature beneath everyone else's.

The contract poofed back into Snatcher's hand, and he smirked. "*Then you'll know that when the time comes, don't worry about finding me - I'll find you. Til then, cat.*"

Then the Subcon Snatcher disappeared into the void of his domain, which dissipated around Cooking Cat, leaving her back on the balcony, back in Mafia Town.

*Well. That was an experience,* she thought to herself.

Then she turned to head back into her apartment.
