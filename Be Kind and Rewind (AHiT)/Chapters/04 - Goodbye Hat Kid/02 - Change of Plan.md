*That same late afternoon...*

"I-I'm just not sure there's a world where we can be happy together."

"But Robin, wasn't it You that said, 'if you believe in something hard enough, nothing can get in our-"

"*CUT!*"

For once, the call *didn't* come from the Conductor. In fact, from the middle of the set emerged the spirit that *had*.

"*Come on, you lot! Break time! I gotta borrow the old man.*"

"Snatcher, ye fool!" Shouted the Conductor from his directors chair. "Can't you tell time?"

"*There's been a change of plan. She's leaving **right now**. We're off to catch her*."

"Fine, fi- OI!" The Snatcher had simply scooped him up under one arm, and without warning, Snatcher dived for the ground again, and the Conductor was swallowed by the darkness-

And next thing he knew, he was on the Moon. It was as if it laid just below the ground floor of the main studio. Was this how Snatcher got around so fast?

Snatcher glanced about, and made for one of the buildings just off the main moon set, one that marked Grooves's office. Spectators gasped upon seeing him - and seeing him with the Conductor screaming out as they both passed straight through the wall.

"Good gracious!" DJ Grooves bolted upright, clutching his heart as both Snatcher *and* the Conductor phased into the room in front of him, the latter screaming. "You gotta warn me before doin' that, darlings! Is it time already?"

"*It wasn't, but she's trying to ditch us early. Hop on, we have two quick stops to make.*"

"Uhh, right..." Grooves slid from his chair and approached them, carefully feeling for a place to hold on to the Snatcher and clinging to him as tightly as he could.

"How come 'e gets a chance and I get scooped up like an infant?!" 

"*You really want me to answer that?*" Snatcher snarked, and once the penguin's heft settled onto him, he once again dived for the floor, and appeared before the throne of the Mafia Boss.

"It's time already?" The Boss asked, a look of amusement on his face glancing over the birds.

"*Sure is! She's making a run. I'm not the most glamorous transport, but rest assured I'm the fastest.*"

"Take his word for it, We've been to the moon and back," groaned the Conductor dangling from his arm, looking like he'd been shocked half to death.

As he picked up his final passenger in the Mafia Town alleyways, Cooking Cat, movement from further up caught Snatcher's attention.

A conspicuously non-Mafia human sat out in front of what seemed like a caf√©, drinking. They were turned away from the group, but even without seeing their face, something about them seemed... familiar. But they'd never seen them before, right?

He shook his head. No, he had something important to do. Whoever this nobody was, they didn't matter until the second they stepped into his forest.

"*Right!*" He said as Cooking Cat chose a spot above DJ Grooves on his body. "*Let's go stop our brat from doing something she'll regret.*"

"One moment, please," said Grooves, tapping a flipper against Snatcher, and the spirit noticed he had also seen the person. "Doesn't that person look out of place?"

"Now that y'all mention it," added Cooking Cat, "I've lived here all my life and done my fair share of travel, and I've *never* seen them before."

"*Uh, time to go?*" prodded Snatcher.

"Does anyone remember seeing them before that accursed castle?" Questioned the Mafia Boss, rubbing his beard in thought.

Each of the crew's eyes opened wide as they came to a similar conclusion. Cooking Cat simply looked between them, confused. "The what now?"

Snatcher sighed. "*Alright,* fine. *They can be our Plan B if the Kid doesn't budge. Now we really must go!*"

Once all the passengers nodded or voiced their approval, Snatcher dove for the ground, and the five of them vanished from Planet Earth.
