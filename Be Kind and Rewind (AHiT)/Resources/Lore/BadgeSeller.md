Badge Seller

- Originally the 'Moonjumper' from an early version of Hat in Time, he was removed from
his original timeline and became of the multiverse when the original concept for
Subcon Forest was shelved
- He since learned how to travel between various realities and universes and
most of what he knows is as a result of his adventures
- His body is 'glitchy' due to his original timeline's destruction - in Alex's
'reality' Badge Seller's files were deleted, but not overwritten
- He is aware of the ways that various multiverses and realities connect to each
other, for example he is aware that Hat in Time is a game in Alex's world
- Could *perhaps* be considered a god due to his knowledge of the inner workings
of the multiverse, but doesn't think of himself as such, he's quite happy living
as the Badge Seller

- Basically, from his experiences, every media, every fanfiction, every
timeline, is indeed real
- "Every place you've ever imagined, is real. There is a fictional city in your
mind and you know every corner of it. Your mind is a world. Each of us is a place" ~ Spitfire Worlds Edit
