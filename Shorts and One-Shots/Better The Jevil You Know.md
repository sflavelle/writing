You come to, and find yourself suspended by your arms somewhere in a darkened room. Your head aches and your arms are numb.

You have no idea how you got here, and your recollection of the moments before ending up here is static, at least right now.

You shake a hand, trying to establish your surroundings. You succeed in brushing your body against whatever stone surface you're chained to, and establish that you've indeed been chained up.

Your head hurts. Actually, a lot of things hurt, now that you're more awake. Your eyes are wide open, but it's so dark in here that it's hard to make anything out.

You consider whether you want to call out for someone, but you decide against it. You don't wish to let whoever brought you here to know that you're awake and ready to be... what, interrogated? Tortured? You don't even know what you might have done to end up here.

Shit's strange.

You retreat into your thoughts...

----

The sound of doors opening, and footsteps getting louder, rouse you from your haze. You're not sure how much time has passed.

Blinking, you start to notice that a light source is nearing, a torch of some kind judging by the light it casts on the floor. Whoever it is is about to round the corner. Who is your captor?

The moment your captor appears, carrying a lit torch, you take him in, a stare of confusion on your features. This guy could give the Blue Man Group a run for their money. Everything you see is just blue. Like him. Inside and outside.

Wait, no, no time for thinking about songs.

He gets close enough to you to take notice of you, and you see from the light that you're in a cell, of a dungeon of some kind. How quaint.

He stops in front of the cell bars, his face takes in the sight of you, and you notice a raised eyebrow. He doesn't look *entirely* human to you, more... 'close enough' to human. It's hard to explain.

He takes a breath, and begins to speak.

"Why hast thou chainedeth yourself upeth?"

You stare at him, expression flat. "...What."

Wait, that was not your voice. It sounded like someone had taken your voice and bitcrushed it, like you were speaking out of one of those Staples 'Easy' buttons or something.

Nonetheless... "Buddy. Pal. Are you *really* going to stand there and tell me that I have hung myself up in a dungeon just because?" Your eyes narrow at him.

"I didst not come hereth to argue," was the man's response, and you cringe at the abysmal attempt at Olde English. 

"Uh huh." You sigh, the sound also bitcrushed. This was *weird*. "I did not come here in the first place. You kidnapped *me*, I assume. I don't even know what I did to you."

"You knoweth full well, what led you here," the blue man said curtly, "or hast thou insanity taken your memorye as welleth, over these monthse?"

"Buddy, you're killing me with your speech," you huff, which causes you to swing lightly from the chains. You hear a quiet jingling from somewhere above your head. You were wearing a hat of some kind, weren't you? "I'm *sure* some time has passed between me waking up here and you coming by, but it *must* have been a day at most, not... months? Are you sure you're not mistaking me for someone else?"

Something seems to click in his head, and he narrows his eyes, taking you in with a more critical expression. Something seems off to him. You take a few breaths, trying your best not to flip out at him. It certainly *seems* like he's expecting you to be someone else.

A minute later, he steps back, hand to his chin in thought.

Then he turns, and leaves down the corridor, toward whatever exit he came from. The light dims around you.

"Hey! At least let me down!" You call out. "I'm already imprisoned, isn't this overkill?!"

He doesn't reply.

You are left to the darkness.

----

It's a while later, and you're back to zoning out in your thoughts.

You still have no idea why anyone has taken enough interest in you to chain you up. Hopefully Mr. Blue Guy, or *someone*, will come down to fill you in.

Because you'd really like some answers.

You become aware of voices coming your way this time. More than one. You recognise Blue Man, but there are others with him, it sounds like.

"...and you are sure it is not a trick?"

"I dost not knoweth. I knoweth that you visited him recently..."

"Well, Mr. Card, we'll do our best to help get to the bottom of this."

"And... ifeth he attacks you?"

"Pssh, we whooped him once! He'd have to be an IDIOT to take us on again!"

Okay, now you're confused. Whoever he's bringing to you this time, it definitely seems like they're all expecting someone else. You pick out a deep feminine voice and a light masculine one.

Then they come around the corner into your vision. There's three of them, not including the man from before.

Your eyes widen. *You know these three.*

Kris, Susie, and... Ralsei, was it? They're characters from that one game... Undergame. Or something.

Okay, that explains Blue Guy.

You take in their details, and note how Susie scowls at you, shifting her grip on the battle axe resting against her shoulder. How Kris seems to just examine you silently, his eyes hidden beneath his bangs. How Ralsei's eyes carefully scan your body.

There's silence for a few long moments.

"...You chained yourself up, Jevil?" Ralsei finally says, confusion on his features.

"Ugh," you begin, rolling your eyes, before you notice that the words also appear in a floating box in front of your eyes. What...? You start to reply, but-

"Didn't think you were into that," Kris says quietly, smirking. Susie snorts at the implied innuendo.

You shoot him a glare. "First of all, you'll have to forgive me, I have no idea who this 'Jevil' is. Second of all, again, *why would I chain myself up* if I've never been here before?! Ughhhhh." Frustrated, you bump your head lightly against the stone, leaning back, looking up at the ceiling of the dungeon.

As you adjust your head, whatever you've been wearing on your head shifts over your eyes, and you shake your head roughly to dislodge the thing. It falls from your head and lands on the stone floor, jingling as it moves.

A black and purple jester's hat.

You stare at it. You weren't wearing that before. You glance down at your body.

And that's when things start to click. You're wearing an outfit that is very clearly not yours, tightly fitting a soft round body, and your skin appears to be dark, unnatural. Between your legs, a thin, long tail peeks out at you.

This isn't your body. "W-wait. What happened to me? Who transformed me into this... clown devil?!" you demand of the group. Oh. Huh. 'Jester devil'. Jevil. That's... a decision that was made. That explains the getup.

"You've always looked like that, dude," Susie remarked. Kris simply continued to stare at you, and Ralsei and Blue share a look.

"Like hell I did!" You bark out. "I was human like, two days ago!"

Kris raises an eyebrow. Then he turns to Ralsei, who is approaching him.

"Kris, may I please have the key?" the goat monster asks. "I'd like to check something." With another glance at you, Kris nods and pulls a key from seemingly nowhere.

Ralsei takes the key, unlocks the cell door that has suddenly appeared between you, and steps in. You can do nothing but watch, as the three filter into the room, Blue Motherfucker deciding to stay back.

The healer lifts a hand, and you feel a ticklish sensation in your chest. You let out a huff, trying not to let it get to you as Ralsei does... whatever he needs to do, the other two protecting him from you.

A few uncomfortable moments later, Ralsei's hand falls, the magic in your chest dissipating, and his eyes widen. "That's not Jevil's SOUL in there, Mr. Rules Card. That's... a human SOUL."

You note that the dialogue box you've been seeing spells his name as 'Rouxls Kaard'. You roll your eyes. This man is ridiculous.

"Truly...?" Rouxls looked at you with a hint of confusion and hesitation. "Then... where *is* his souleth?"

God, *please* stop.

"If I had to guess..." Ralsei paused, thinking. "Jevil may have cast a bodyswap spell to escape, somehow."

What. Your eyes open wide. "So the guy who y'all think *I* am, is running around somewhere in *my* body?!" You scowl.

A look is shared between the group in front of you. "That's... a problem," Kris murmurs.

"Are you sure, pipsqueak?" Susie eyes Ralsei.

"...Positive," he says after a moment's thought. "Have you heard him repeating himself? His calls for 'chaos, chaos!' and the like?"

She looks at you with suspicion, seeming to think over what her companion has said about you.

Then she begins to approach you, shifting the axe properly into her hands.

Your stomach drops. "Wait, what the hell?" You cry out, beginning to panic. "Stop! Didn't you hear him? I'm innocent! I'm-- AHHH!"

Your eyes slam shut as she lifts the battle axe and takes a swing.

You hear a deep **thud**, one that reverberates through your body and --

Your chains snap, instantly cleaved in two.

Your eyes snap back open as you fall the 3 feet to the ground, your legs immediately buckling, and your arms searing with pain now that they aren't numb from being pulled upward for so long. You choke back a few deep breaths amidst a stream of curses, seeing the now broken chains around your wrists. "F-fuh... fuckin' hell... Nearly pissed myself, give a guy a fuckin' warning next time."

Susie allows herself a snort at the profanity sprouting from the chaos jester's mouth. "Okay, fine, yeah, that's not him. So if you're in *his* body, where's *your* body?"

You take a few deep breaths first, curling an aching arm around your - his - chest. "Well, he'll be--"

Your eyes widen. Wait. "He's... in another universe."

"...He's managed to escape to the Light World?!" Ralsei asks, a panic in his voice.

You shake your head, and slowly clamber to your feet. "World's a world, dude. No, I'm... separate, from all this. Living an entirely different life. None of this... magic, monsters. Not a thing. I'm from a different universe completely."

There was silence as you finally stood, and you looked at the jester hat on the ground. You reached out with a blue-grey, clawed hand to pick it up, looking it over. "Guess that means either my world's fucked, or... or he is, heh. Depending on where the magic went."

Kris frowned. "A conundrum."

"I wish I could help you more on finding him." You shook your head. 

"We'll find a way," you heard Ralsei say, and you are surprised when you suddenly feel his paw on your shoulder. You look up at them and smile. 

He turns to the group. "Well, looks like we've got a mystery to solve, hmm?" He grins.

"Sounds like a plan, squirt!" Susie grins, exposing her sharp teeth and clenching a fist. "The lil idiot won't know what hit him!"

She rushed out of the cell, and quickly vanished out of sight. "Susie, wait!" Ralsei called after her, following.

Kris started to follow after them, then paused, looking at you with a curious look to their expression.

Then they also turned and left, leaving you with Rouxls Kaard. What a name. What a stupid, stupid name. Now that the others were gone, you were unchained, and the cell door was still wide open, he watched you with some apprehension, as if you were going to show your true colors now that the Lightners were gone. You cocked your head to the side, raising an eyebrow. "I suppose you're going to lock me back up now, huh?"

He hesitated before answering. "I... don't knoweth." Though he stood in place, hands clasped behind back like some sort of butler, he seemed... conflicted. "It would indeedst appear thou art not the jester in SOULeth. However, I still feelst thy magic courseth through thy body."

Either Rouxls was being kind in ignoring your winces at his speech, or this happened all the time with him.

It took you a moment to process what he just said, and your eyes shot up to his, narrowing. "What? I have his magic? ...Why did you not tell them?"

"I couldst nay get a word in," was his response, a soft smile on his features.

"Hah." You chuckle, and sigh. Slowly, lifting your hands up, you approach the cell door. You watch as Rouxls gives you some distance. "Well, if it ah, 'pleaseth thee'," you allow yourself a smirk, "would you have any issue with me tagging along for a bit, so I can at least see whereever it is I've ended up?"

He hums in thought. You offer, "If you wish I can return here after the fact..."

He looks at you with a curious expression. "I wouldst normally need to asketh the king of such a favour..."

"Ah. Theocracy, huh? Fair. Can't say I didn't try--"

"Howevereth, the King of Spades is currently indisposed." With a sly smile, he steps aside, allowing you to exit. "Therefore, the decision is mineth to make. I will allow this of thee."

Your jaw opens, and you gape at him. "That's... putting a lot of trust in me." You carefully bow. "I'll remember this. Thank you."

Rouxls' smile this time is much more genuine. "I bid thee welcome to the Card Kingdom. What is thy name?"

----

You're allowed to swap the jester garb you woke up in for something more... 'normal' (normal for this world, at least), before you are guided in a tour of Card Castle. You learn that the Jevil situation is to do with him being corrupted by a 'Dark World', and that the forces of Dark and Light are out of balance, which is why Kris, Susie, and Ralsei are around, aiming to close something called a 'Dark Fountain' and stabilise the worlds that are being corrupted.

Rouxls, in return, learns your name, and you talk to him of the world in which you came from, of your modern technology and the pressures of modern society.

Which is how you ended up telling him, at a pause in his tour, as you both stood leaning over the castle walls, looking down into the appropriately named Castle Town, that now that the shock had worn off, this deviation in your life was... somewhat exciting. "I was, as I guess is the appropriate term here, a 'commoner'," you tell him, scratching a claw over your cheek. "People rely on the speed of machines quite a lot, and then just assume you can perform as quick and fast as one," you scowl. "It's ridiculous! They want you to be quality control, but you don't even get *half a second* to just scan it nowadays! It's all 'go go go' and 'faster, faster'! It destroys me. I *would* rather be back in that cell of yours than have to do that again."

You rest your head on your arms on the castle wall, letting out a sigh. "I get this is a change that isn't exactly wanted... for you guys and for my world, but... I'll make the most of it while I'm here, I suppose."

Rouxls nods, and leans forward against the wall with you. "...A thought occurs," he says, looking at you curiously. "Jevil was imprisonedeth so long ago, and I suspect this world may soon meeteth its end..."

"What?!" You gasp, turning toward him. "I-I'm sorry, I-"

He shakes his head. "This... decay, exists due to the Dark Fountain bringing it into existence. This is my understanding, speaking to the Dark Prince Ralsei. ...Perhaps, this is a chance to reset. To let the expectations ebbeth away, let the darkness in our souls shape us into what we desire to be."

"...I'm not sure that I want to let the darkness in my soul win," you say quietly, almost to yourself.

"'Tis a different darkness," Rouxls clarifies. "We needst nay play the roles we were placed in. Thy opportunity strikes to be reborn, to nay be Y/N the Commoner, nay Jevil, Jester of Chaos. ...Nay Rouxls Kaard, the civil servant."

You glance at him. Is he having an identity crisis too?

A gentle breeze brushes through as you both watch the Card Kingdom pass you by.

----

Assuming Jevil's identity has come with benefits and drawbacks.

The body you now assumed being... rather a shock to see in full. 

The mirror that hung on the far side of your temporary quarters drew up to about twice your size. And if you were concerned about the clothing and the skin colour and the tail, the face that stared back at you was a shock to the system.

You befitted the name 'Jevil' for sure. 

Pudgy cheeks and an impish mouth and fangs hung beneath pointed crosses painted around the eyes, like a black four-pointed star. (Weren't save points in the other game 'stars' in the same way?) Your eyes, to go with them, were black like something demonic, with golden irises that almost glowed in contrast. 

The purple-blue skin was ever so slightly fuzzy, very short fur growing. It felt... strangely pleasant to the touch, as did the chubbiness on your new frame, evidence of the jester's previous lavish life in the castle. You wondered if it was because of his curvature that his outfit, and indeed anything you could find to wear, was so... form-fitting.

Despite discovering that you look like some kind of devil doll, and those in the Castle who had witnessed Jevil's downfall turning to run whenever they crossed paths with you, you found you didn't mind the body so much. 

No, your desire was to learn magic. Having grown up in a world without it, and the constant hum of energy coursing through your body left you wanting an outlet, wanting to experiment.

Which is how you would find yourself in the archives for most of your free time, sat at a table quietly, a stack of history and theory books about magic by your side, and occasionally trying to figure out some basic spells - casting light, or healing, or something. 

It wasn't working out yet, but you wanted to be able to do it at least once, even if it wasn't going to follow you once you were reunited with your own body.

----

A few weeks later, there is a knock at the door to your quarters. You have been summoned to the front of the castle, told that the Lightners have returned with news for you.

You wear Jevil's jester getup today, assuming it is time to get back to your old life, and to put the chaotic soul back in his cell. 

When you arrive, Rouxls is being regaled by Ralsei with tales of the team's adventures while Kris and Susie stand behind him quietly (a little awkwardly, in Susie's case). They notice you immediately as you enter, and they examine you with some concern as you walk up to them. "Hello, hello!" you call, slightly absently - you miss how those present tense up at the repetition. "Great to see you all again. Travelling well?"

Ralsei nods, but there's an expression of concern and reluctance on his face. "Yes! Uh, the corruption from the Dark World's influence has been stopped! We've... um, sealed the Fountain, and nothing should come through to torment this world again!"

"Oh! Well, that's excellent news, isn't it! The day will grace this kingdom once more, will it not?"

"Indeed!" Ralsei allowed a smile. 

Kris stepped toward you, and you turned to face him. His expression was unreadable. "Would you like the good news or the bad news first?" He asked.

You thought for a moment, tapping your foot on the floor. "I've always been of the opinion that receiving the good news first will temper the bad news."

Kris nodded. With a brief glance toward the others, the Lightner launched into it. "We found you. Your body, I mean."

"Oh! Amazing!" You gaped. You didn't even know they could *reach* your reality. "And was the little bastard pretending to be me?"

"Not really 'pretending'," Susie chuckled, but her expression was similarly strange. "But yeah. Don't worry, that Jevil is history now."

"Nice! Good work!" You grinned at them. "Thank you for saving me from a world of embarrassment. I can only imagine what he could have done in my body. Now, what's the bad news?"

The foyer was silent. There were grim looks on the groups' faces. Rouxls held a hand to his mouth, eyes wide, shocked. 

"...Guys...?"

They watched as you visibly processed what they told you. 

Jevil was in your body. Now Jevil was gone, and your body was safe.

That was how it worked! Right?

Right...? Because the alternative would be...

That your body was...

Your eyes slowly widened, and ever so slowly you turned in place toward Ralsei. By the time you faced him completely, there was a deep fear in your eyes. 

He faced you for a tense, long moment, but eventually his gaze broke away from you and, uncomfortable, he whispered three words that broke you, struck a sharp pain in your soul. 

"I'm sorry, Y/N."

A choked gasp forced its way from your open mouth. 

No.

He hadn't.

Jevil couldn't have gotten you killed. 

He just couldn't have.

You stood silently for a long moment, just staring off into space. 

The life you had lived before, as *yourself*, was over. 

Because some idiot jester had to keep fucking around, now you were stuck in *this* body forever.

After what felt like minutes of silence, you seemed to unfreeze, and the words started to tumble out. "...I... Fuck, man. That's not- ...Why would he do that? Why- god, my friends- What about my roommate?! They're- Fucking Jevil- I had a whole life- Why does shit never want to work out for- FUCKING **JEVIL!**"

Somewhere in the midst of your rambling, subconsciously, a scythe had fizzled into existence in your hands, and your friends ducked out of the way as you swung it about in your raving. The buzz of Jevil's magic within you surged through your palms into the blade, and as you swung the blade down, punctuating your final exclamation, you felt it catch on *nothing*, then slice.

As the blade cut through the air, a *hole* in the space in front of you opened, a window into another world.

A window into *your* world.

Interrupted by the sight, you blankly stared at the view on the other side.

Then, you moved to wedge the scythe into the hole, such that it shouldn't close, then, the moment over, you trembled and slowly fell to your knees.

There you were.

What was left of your own body, that was.

It seemed you had been shot to death, somewhere in the alleyway of a city. Blood had dried around your chest.

Barely thinking, you stumbled to your feet and approached the portal, the others approaching behind. You climbed through, noting that Rouxls did as well, and you stared at your own glassy expression.

This was an awful sight to see. You reached out slowly, with your clawed hands, to carefully close the human body's eyelids.

And then, surrounded by your new monster friends (and Kris), you began to sob uncontrollably, mourning the death of your old life.

----

The next few days are spent on autopilot, barely able to ingest any information from your pile of books, or from Rouxls and Ralsei.

You didn't know what to do. 

You found yourself wondering, for the first time in several months of living both as yourself and as Jevil, how much more bullshit you could handle. 

The thrum of magic coursing through you promises the ability to change. Change what? How?

You needed advice, a purpose.

Perhaps, a look into this world's past could provide a hint for how you could contribute to Castle Town's future. 

And that's how you ended up walking along the streets one day, looking out for the local shop. Rouxls had told you that someone there had once known Jevil quite well, before he had... lost it.

Interestingly, by this point, people had adjusted to your presence and the idea  of 'Jevil' being reformed. Walking around here made the reality that you were just, living among monsters now quite real. At least while you were out in the castle, things seemed like more of a fantasy...

It was no longer a very long, strange dream.

You came across a tent that proclaimed to be a shop. Slowing to a stop in front of it, you mentally prepared to meet this creature, and quite possibly let them down.

Taking some deep breaths, you removed the hat from your head, and with a final swallowing of the nerves, you opened the flap of the tent and stepped inside.
