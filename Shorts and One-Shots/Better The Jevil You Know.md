You come to, and find yourself suspended by your arms somewhere in a darkened room. Your head aches and your arms are numb.

You have no idea how you got here, and your recollection of the moments before ending up here is static, at least right now.

You shake a hand, trying to establish your surroundings. You succeed in brushing your body against whatever stone surface you're chained to, and establish that you've indeed been chained up.

Your head hurts. Actually, a lot of things hurt, now that you're more awake. Your eyes are wide open, but it's so dark in here that it's hard to make anything out.

You consider whether you want to call out for someone, but you decide against it. You don't wish to let whoever brought you here to know that you're awake and ready to be... what, interrogated? Tortured? You don't even know what you might have done to end up here.

Shit's strange.

You retreat into your thoughts...

----

The sound of doors opening, and footsteps getting louder, rouse you from your haze. You're not sure how much time has passed.

Blinking, you start to notice that a light source is nearing, a torch of some kind judging by the light it casts on the floor. Whoever it is is about to round the corner. Who is your captor?

The moment your captor appears, carrying a lit torch, you take him in, a stare of confusion on your features. This guy could give the Blue Man Group a run for their money. Everything you see is just blue. Like him. Inside and outside.

Wait, no, no time for thinking about songs.

He gets close enough to you to take notice of you, and you see from the light that you're in a cell, of a dungeon of some kind. How quaint.

He stops in front of the cell bars, his face takes in the sight of you, and you notice a raised eyebrow. He doesn't look *entirely* human to you, more... 'close enough' to human. It's hard to explain.

He takes a breath, and begins to speak.

"Why hast thou chainedeth yourself upeth?"

You stare at him, expression flat. "...What."

Wait, that was not your voice. It sounded like someone had taken your voice and bitcrushed it, like you were speaking out of one of those Staples 'Easy' buttons or something.

Nonetheless... "Buddy. Pal. Are you *really* going to stand there and tell me that I have hung myself up in a dungeon just because?" Your eyes narrow at him.

"I didst not come hereth to argue," was the man's response, and you cringe at the abysmal attempt at Olde English. 

"Uh huh." You sigh, the sound also bitcrushed. This was *weird*. "I did not come here in the first place. I don't even know what I did to you."

"You knoweth full well, what led you here," the blue man said curtly, "or hast thou insanity taken your memory as welleth, over these monthseth?"

"Buddy, you're killing me with your speech," you huff, which causes you to swing lightly from the chains. You hear a quiet jingling from somewhere above your head. You were wearing a hat of some kind, weren't you? "I'm *sure* some time has passed between me waking up here and you coming by, but it *must* have been a day at most, not... months? Are you sure you're not mistaking me for someone else?"

Something seems to click in his head, and he narrows his eyes, taking you in with a more critical expression. Something seems off to him. You take a few breaths, trying your best not to flip out at him. It certainly *seems* like he's expecting you to be someone else.

A minute later, he steps back, hand to his chin in thought.

Then he turns, and leaves down the corridor, toward whatever exit he came from. The light dims around you.

"Hey! At least let me down!" You call out. "I'm already imprisoned, isn't this overkill?!"

He doesn't reply.

You are left to the darkness.

----

It's a while later, and you're back to zoning out in your thoughts.

You still have no idea why anyone has taken enough interest in you to chain you up. Hopefully Mr. Blue Guy, or *someone*, will come down to fill you in.

Because you'd really like some answers.

You become aware of voices coming your way this time. More than one. You recognise Blue Man, but there are others with him, it sounds like.

"...and you are sure it is not a trick?"

"I dost not knoweth. I knoweth that you visited him recently..."

"Well, Mr. Card, we'll do our best to help get to the bottom of this."

"And... ifeth he attacks you?"

"Pssh, we whooped him once! He'd have to be an IDIOT to take us on again!"

Okay, now you're confused. Whoever he's bringing to you this time, it definitely seems like they're all expecting someone else. You pick out a deep feminine voice and a light masculine one.

Then they come around the corner into your vision. There's three of them, not including the man from before.

Your eyes widen. *You know these three.*

Kris, Susie, and... Ralsei, was it? They're characters from that one game... Undergame. Or something.

Okay, that explains Blue Guy.

You take in their details, and note how Susie scowls at you, shifting her grip on the battle axe resting against her shoulder. How Kris seems to just examine you silently, his eyes hidden beneath his bangs. How Ralsei's eyes carefully scan your body.

There's silence for a few long moments.

"...You chained yourself up, Jevil?" Ralsei finally says, confusion on his features.

"Ugh," you begin, rolling your eyes, before you notice that the words also appear in a floating box in front of your eyes. What...? You start to reply, but-

"Didn't think you were into that," Kris says quietly, smirking. Susie snorts at the implied innuendo.

You shoot him a glare. "First of all, you'll have to forgive me, I have no idea who this 'Jevil' is. Second of all, again, *why would I chain myself up* if I've never been here before?! Ughhhhh." Frustrated, you bump your head lightly against the stone, leaning back, looking up at the ceiling of the dungeon.

As you adjust your head, whatever you've been wearing on your head shifts over your eyes, and you shake your head roughly to dislodge the thing. It falls from your head and lands on the stone floor.

A black and purple jester's hat.

You stare at it. You weren't wearing that before. You glance down at your body.

And that's when things start to click. You're wearing an outfit that is very clearly not yours, not proportioned for *you*, and your skin appears to be dark, unnatural. Between your legs, a thin, long tail peeks out at you.

This isn't your body. "W-wait. What happened to me? Who transformed me into this... clown devil?!" you demand of the group. Oh. Huh. 'Jester devil'. Jevil. That's... a decision that was made.

"You've always looked like that, dude," Susie remarked. Kris simply continued to stare at you, and Ralsei and Blue share a look.

"Like hell I did!" You bark out. "I was human like, two days ago!"

Kris raises an eyebrow. Then he turns to Ralsei, who is approaching him.

"Kris, may I please have the key?" the goat monster asks. With another glance at you, Kris nods and pulls a key from seemingly nowhere.

Ralsei takes the key, unlocks the cell door that has suddenly appeared between you, and steps in. You can do nothing but watch, as the three filter into the room, Blue Motherfucker deciding to stay back.

The healer lifts a hand, and you feel a ticklish sensation in your chest. You let out a huff, trying not to let it get to you as Ralsei does... whatever he needs to do, the other two protecting him from you.

A few uncomfortable moments later, Ralsei's hand falls, the magic in your chest dissipating, and his eyes widen. "That's not Jevil's SOUL in there, Mr. Rules Card. That's... a human SOUL."

You note that the dialogue box you've been seeing spells his name as 'Rouxls Kaard'. You roll your eyes. This man is ridiculous.

"Truly...?" Rouxls looked at you with a hint of confusion and hesitation. "Then... where *is* his souleth?"

God, *please* stop.

"If I had to guess..." Ralsei paused, thinking. "Jevil may have cast a bodyswap spell to escape, somehow."

What. Your eyes open wide. "So the guy who y'all think *I* am, is running around somewhere in *my* body?!" You scowl.

A look is shared between the group in front of you. "That's... a problem," Kris murmurs.

"Are you sure, pipsqueak?" Susie eyes Ralsei.

"...Positive," he says after a moment's thought. "Have you heard him repeating himself? His calls for 'chaos, chaos!' and the like?"

She looks at you with suspicion, seeming to think over what her companion has said about you.

Then she begins to approach you, shifting the axe properly into her hands.

Your stomach drops. "Wait, what the hell?" You cry out, beginning to panic. "Stop! Didn't you hear him? I'm innocent! I'm-- AHHH!"

Your eyes slam shut as she lifts the battle axe and takes a swing.

You hear a deep **thud**, and --

Your chains snap.

Your eyes snap back open as you fall the 3 feet to the ground, your legs immediately buckling, and your arms searing with pain now that they aren't numb from being pulled upward for so long. You choke back a few deep breaths amidst a stream of curses, seeing the now broken chains around your wrists. "F-fuh... fuckin' hell... Nearly pissed myself, give a guy a fuckin' warning next time."

Susie allows herself a snort at the profanity sprouting from the chaos jester's mouth. "Okay, fine, yeah, that's not him. So if you're in *his* body, where's *your* body?"

You take a few deep breaths first, curling an aching arm around your - his - chest. "Well, he'll be--"

Your eyes widen. Wait. "He's... in another universe."

"...He's managed to escape to the Light World?!" Ralsei asks, a panic in his voice.

You shake your head, and slowly clamber to your feet. "World's a world, dude. No, I'm... separate, from all this. Living an entirely different life. None of this... magic, monsters. Not a thing. I'm from a different universe completely."

There was silence as you finally stood, and you looked at the jester hat on the ground. You reached out with a purple-grey, clawed hand to pick it up, looking it over. "Guess that means either my world's fucked, or... or he is, heh. Depending on where the magic went."

Kris frowned. "A conundrum."

"I wish I could help you more on finding him." You shook your head. 

"We'll find a way," you heard Ralsei say, and you are surprised when you suddenly feel his paw on your shoulder. You look up at them and smile. 

He turns to the group. "Well, looks like we've got a mystery to solve before we close up this fountain, hmm?" He grins.

"Sounds like a plan, squirt!" Susie grins, exposing her sharp teeth and clenching a fist. "The lil idiot won't know what hit him!"

She rushed out of the cell, and quickly vanished out of sight. "Susie, wait!" Ralsei called after her, following.

Kris started to follow after them, then paused, looking at you with a curious look to their expression.

Then they also turned and left, leaving you with Rouxls Kaard. What a name. What a stupid, stupid name. Now that the others were gone, you were unchained, and the cell door was still wide open, he watched you with some apprehension, as if you were going to show your true colors now that the Lightners were gone. You cocked your head to the side, raising an eyebrow. "I suppose you're going to lock me back up now, huh?"

He hesitated before answering. "I... don't knoweth." Though he stood in place, hands clasped behind back like some sort of butler, he seemed... conflicted. "It would indeedst appear thou art not the jester in SOULeth. However, I still feelst thou magic courseth through thy body."

Either Rouxls was being kind in ignoring your winces at his speech, or this happened all the time with him.

It took you a moment to process what he just said, and your eyes shot up to his, narrowing. "What? I have his magic? ...Why did you not tell them?"

"I couldst nay get a word in," was his response, a soft smile on his features.

"Hah." You chuckle, and sigh. Slowly, lifting your hands up, you approach the cell door. You watch as Rouxls gives you some distance. "Well, if it ah, 'pleaseth thee'," you allow yourself a smirk, "would you have any issue with me tagging along for a bit, so I can at least see whereever it is I've ended up?"

He hums in thought. You offer, "If you wish I can return here after the fact..."

He looks at you with a curious expression. "I wouldst normally need to asketh the king of such a favour..."

"Ah. Theocracy, huh? Fair. I tried--"

"Howevereth, the King of Spades is vanquished." With a sly smile, he steps aside, allowing you to exit. "Therefore, the decision is mineth to make. I will allow this of thee."

Your jaw opens, and you gape at him. "That's... putting a lot of trust in me." You carefully bow. "I'll remember this. Thank you."

Rouxls' smile this time is much more genuine. "I bid thee welcome to the Card Kingdom. What is thy name?"

----

You're allowed to swap the jester garb you woke up in for something more... 'normal' (normal for this world, at least), before you are guided in a tour of Card Castle. You learn that the Jevil situation is to do with him being corrupted by a 'Dark World', and that the forces of Dark and Light are out of balance, which is why Kris, Susie, and Ralsei are around, aiming to close something called a 'Dark Fountain'.

Rouxls, in return, learns your name, and you talk to him of the world in which you came from, of your modern technology and the pressures of modern society.

Which is how you ended up telling him, at a pause in his tour, as you both stood leaning over the castle walls, looking down into the appropriately named Castle Town, that now that the shock had worn off, this deviation in your life was... somewhat exciting. "I was, as I guess is the appropriate term here, a 'commoner'," you tell him, scratching a claw over your cheek. "People rely on the speed of machines quite a lot, and then just assume you can perform as quick and fast as one," you scowl. "It's ridiculous! They want you to be quality control, but you don't even get *half a second* to just scan it nowadays! It's all 'go go go' and 'faster, faster'! It destroys me. I *would* rather be back in that cell of yours than have to do that again."

You rest your head on your arms on the castle wall, letting out a sigh. "I get this is a change that isn't exactly wanted... for you guys and for my world, but... I'll make the most of it while I'm here, I suppose."

Rouxls nods, and leans forward against the wall with you. "...A thought occurs," he says, looking at you curiously. "Jevil was imprisonedeth so long ago, and I suspect this world may soon meeteth its end..."

"What?!" You gasp, turning toward him. "I-I'm sorry, I-"

He shakes his head. "This... decay, exists due to the Dark Fountain bringing it into existence. This is my understanding, speaking to the Dark Prince Ralsei. ...Perhaps, this is a chance to reset. To let the expectations ebbeth away, let the darkness in our souls shape us into what we desire to be."

"...I'm not sure that I want to let the darkness in my soul win," you say quietly, almost to yourself.

"'Tis a different darkness," Rouxls clarifies. "We needst nay play the roles we were placed in. Thy opportunity strikes to be reborn, to nay be Y/N the Commoner, nay Jevil, Jester of Chaos. ...Nay Rouxls Kaard, the civil servant."

You glance at him. Is he having an identity crisis too?

A gentle breeze brushes through as you both watch the Card Kingdom pass you by.

----

Assuming Jevil's identity has come with benefits and drawbacks.

Despite discovering that you look like some kind of devil doll, and those in the Castle who had witnessed Jevil's downfall turning to run whenever they crossed paths with you, you found you didn't mind the body so much. 

No, your desire was to learn magic. Having grown up in a world without it, and the constant hum of energy coursing through your body left you wanting an outlet, wanting to experiment.

----

A few weeks later, there is a knock at the door to your quarters.
