> *Good afternoon, 47.*

> *Your destination is the Dead Bird Studios movie studio in Bird California, where your two targets are currently deep in filming:*

> - *The Conductor. Scottish western enthusiast, he is the breadwinner of the studio, with 46 of the studio's 47 award wins going to him. But that fame is on the back of scores of staff abuse claims, dangerous use of explosives, and even a few attempted terrorism felonies to his name. Filming for one of his most recent endeavours, 'Train Rush', destroyed several kilometers of the country's railway network, for which he denies any guilt.*

> - *Also marked for termination is the charismatic DJ Grooves. Chronic runner-up of Bird California's annual Bird Movie Awards, this moon penguin might seem calm and 'cool' in the public eye, but his private activities suggest something much more sinister and unhinged beneath the surface.*

> *The studio is built on a long and bitter rivalry between the two directors, which has only exacerbated after an award win by DJ Grooves five years ago - the director's only first place win in the Bird Movie Award institution's long history. On your arrival both directors will be planning the next steps for their films, surrounded by their actors... but I won't put it past you to be able to lure them away from their comfort zone.*

> *Our client, Haley Komett, child star of the studio's film season last year, also requests that we retrieve evidence of her attempted murder post-season. She alleges that a disagreement over ownership over one of the movies' props led to an attack down in the depths of the studio, but the studio is of course denying all claims the event took place. There are bound to be physical clues and loose-lipped staff on your way to the basement.*

> *A movie studio provides plenty of opportunities for bringing karmic justice to your two targets. I know you'll ensure that these directors won't play lightly with the lives of innocents again.*

> *I shall leave you to prepare.*

**OBJECTIVES:**
- **Eliminate The Conductor**
- **Eliminate DJ Grooves**
- **Gather Attempted Murder Clues (0/4)**
