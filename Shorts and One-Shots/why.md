on your darker days, you always thought that your life was a cruel experiment. you didn't really believe in a god, but you still felt this to be the truth:

that your life was a test to see how much pain, how much injustice, how much cruelty could one person take before they finally crumbled.

well, you could finally say to whoever was in charge of you that they had their answer.

as it turned out, 33 years of mental disability, 15 years of depression, 7 years of mindless work... made to feel like a machine in human skin, your growing aches and pains ignored...

unable to help those you cared about. your 'best' shot at life being to abandon the one person who needed you most, the person for whom you strove to make your unit as queer-friendly as possible for.

...yeah that would do it.

instead you managed to get your housemate moved in into your family's home.

'what about you?' don't worry, you had something figured out.

heh.

you felt your heart pound in your chest even as your dull eyes stared down at the lighter in your gasoline-soaked hands. you willed yourself to try to feel something, anything, that wasn't a general sense of 'this is what needs to be done'.

it was funny, in a way.

you wished and wished, when you were feeling so severely depressed among people at work, that surely someone would notice something was up, someone would just ask 'hey, you alright?'.

maybe you were just scary to look at. maybe people were just thinking about themselves. maybe they just didn't actually care. ~~maybe they wanted you to just get it over with.~~

but now that you were actually going through with this, only now do you hide away. driving out to the middle of fucking nowhere. well okay, it was just off an intersection on an arterial road, pulled off onto a dusty ground away from where your burning body would set anything else alight. but really, who was going to care enough to pull over to see what a random car was doing?

(you knew the answer already. you'd spent the night out there once before,sleeping in the driver's seat, months ago, feeling like you 'weren't allowed' to go home.)

and after all, your mind was sure to remind you at every turn that you were the cause of everything that was wrong in the world. that your death would make everything better. that your friends and colleagues would probably fucking celebrate once word of your death reached them.

you knew, in the back of your mind, that of course you weren't *everything* wrong. but that didn't stop you from believing it anyway.

and wasn't that just pathetic.

it was this thought you left yourself with as you flicked on the lighter, and it sparks to life.

and your dying screams don't last long.
