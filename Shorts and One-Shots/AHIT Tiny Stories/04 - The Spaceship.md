"Okay, we're here," said Bow, and Lily felt the bag settle as it was gently lowered onto a solid surface. A moment later, light streamed into the interior as it was opened up, and Bow's face was smiling down at her. "You ready to take a look around?"

"You sure?" Lily scrambled to her feet, having sat amongst assorted Time Pieces, assorted miniature plushes and wallets of pons.

"I'm sure!" Bow beamed down at her, a warm and friendly smile. "It's just you and me here." An annoyed beep sounded from somewhere. "Oh, and Rumbi," she added with a giggle.

"Uh- I thought it was just you and the other kid." Lily furrowed a brow.

"Huh? Oh, no, don't worry - Rumbi is just our cleaning robot. Here - take a look."

Lily expected the statement to be followed by a hand reaching in for her, but instead Bow Kid stepped away from the bag, allowing her to climb out on her own power.

*Whoa,* the borrower thought. This human(?) kid was more mature and understanding than most adult creatures she had seen. After a moment to mentally move Bow up the list of 'Favorite Beans' (an admittedly very, *very* short list), she scrambled up to the lip of Bow's bag and peered out.

And her jaw dropped.

The space kids' spaceship was almost like a playground. The area she found herself in was massive, seemingly even for the beans that ran it. The carpeted main area was home to a TV with games console, a gumball machine, a *slide???*, and what looked like a massive bank vault.

"Is... is this really your spaceship? It looks like a playground!" The borrower gawped.

"Yep!" Bow beamed. "Isn't it wonderful?"

"...I can't say I'm not intrigued," Lily admitted.

"But, uh, you wanna know the best part?" The bean continued. "Turn around and check out the view we get."

Lily did so.

And the tiny human's mind rhetorically shattered.

Amongst a vast sea of blue and orange and black and white, a massive orb filled the vision.
