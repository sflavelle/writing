Lily waited, barely hearing the sound of footsteps as one of the kids walked off, leaving the one called 'Bow'. Of the two, she was the one the borrower would most want to talk to right now.

Considering they'd found out about her.

She heard a noise on the other side of the wall between them as Bow climbed up onto the concrete again, this time sitting right against the nook in the wall, almost hiding it away from sight. The soft pastel greens of her dress cast its color on the wall inside, and despite the stress in her chest, Lily thought it looked pretty.

There was silence between the two for a bit.

"...Are you still there?" Bow asked, softly. 

Lily sighed, crouched and leaning against her side of the wall. Despite her apprehension she replied, "...yeah, I'm still here."

A brief pause. "I'm sorry for my friend. She... well, I guess you heard. She doesn't mean harm."

The borrower nodded silently. She seemed the more excitable of the two - the girl with the hat seemed the kind to... need to touch things. "...How do you know so much about me? About us?"

Bow chuckled. "There's stories that go around the corners of the Galactic Network. Niche message boards that discuss the possible existence of little people. Blog posts of encounters, sometimes from the borrowers themselves. It's... not publically known, and the vibe I get is people wanna keep it that way. But there's enough info out there that if you... are curious about these things, you can put two and two together. Nothing from this planet, though. This planet here has no idea..."

Lily's eyes widened. "Wait... are you not from here?"

Bow giggled in response. "You could kinda say I'm an alien."

"Whoa..."

Lily got to her feet, and slowly stepped around to the hole in the wall separating her from Bow.

The humanoid child was sat just outside her nook, the fabric of her dress blocking the borrower from view outside the two of them. As Lily looked upward, she saw her head was resting gently against the wall. She wasn't looking at her nook, rather she was just staring out toward the Metro, giving no indication that she was talking to someone like her. It was... surprisingly considerate.

"What about you?" Bow asked, still looking away. "How did you end up down here?"

Lily hesitated briefly. "...Got... separated from my group a couple weeks back. I uh... I mistimed a jump from somewhere higher up, fell down here. They couldn't afford to come back for me, I guess."

"Shit," Bow breathed. "I'm so sorry."

"Thanks. I don't blame them really, I figured I should have been dead for sure."

"So you've always lived in the Metro?"

"Pretty much..."

"Hmm..." Bow went quiet for a few long moments, and Lily, feeling more comfortable, lowered herself to the ground just inside the opening to her nook, leaning back against the wall. "Is there a way we could help you...?"

"No, no I... well..." Lily paused, finding herself thinking about the trouble she'd had getting food most of the time... The times she'd feared for her life when the cats' sharp vision caught her, and she'd hidden in terror as their arms and claws reached into whatever opening she'd hidden in, trying to catch her... Would it be worth asking... But could she trust them with her life? "I... wouldn't mind getting out of here, if you knew of somewhere that someone like me could live peacefully..."

Bow raised an eyebrow. Well... Mafia Town was *probably* the most docile place on the planet for a borrower, with the Mafia themselves lazy, always leaving trash laying around, but it still held some danger. Bird California would be too hot, the Moon too cold, and the birds themselves would probably see her as food. Subcon... nothing for a borrower there, and eyes *everywhere*. And the Alpine Skyline, while safe, wouldn't grow anywhere near enough for her to sustain herself on.

She glanced down at the nook briefly... What if... "What about our spaceship? As part of our crew. It's just me and Hattie, oh and our cleaning robot, there's plenty of leftovers and places someone your size could explore, and there's nothing you would really need to do in return. Just, y'know, let us know what we can do to make your space journey comfortable, and maybe now and then you could help us with resolving time anomalies?" She hastily added, "Don't feel obligated to say yes though. And I don't want you to feel like you'd be a pet to us. A companion, sure! But I'd want you to be an equal, y'know?"

Lily was silent for a while as she took in this information, reflecting on what Bow said as well as what she *hadn't* said. "So... this... planet isn't a safe place for us borrowers?"

"Honestly, it's not a safe place, *period*." Bow smiled at the tiny snort in response. "Some decent people, sure, but all still very dangerous. That's why I personally feel like your best chance is with us. You've got enough room for your own autonomy, and a support network through me and Hattie should you need it."

"Autonomy...?" Lily said it slowly, sounding out the word. It wasn't one she'd heard before. 

Bow giggled. "Independence? You could probably just make your own life in and around our spaceship if you wanted, it doesn't have to revolve around us."

Though she knew this could be a trap, the appeal of escaping the life of constant apprehension was tempting. This 'Bow' seemed genuine enough, even saving her from her friend. She would have to get used to the two of them, but...

Lily's head turned to face the living space she had been using for the past few days. Barren, save a small bed of tissue paper, and beside it the knapsack of her things, barely opened in case she had to bug out once more. 

The little human sighed deeply.
