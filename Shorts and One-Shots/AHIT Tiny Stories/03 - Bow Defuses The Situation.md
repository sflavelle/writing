Lily waited, barely hearing the sound of footsteps as one of the kids walked off, leaving the one called 'Bow'. Of the two, she was the one the borrower would most want to talk to right now.

Considering they'd found out about her.

She heard a noise on the other side of the wall between them as Bow climbed up onto the concrete again, this time sitting right against the nook in the wall, almost hiding it away from sight. The soft pastel greens of her dress cast its color on the wall inside, and despite the stress in her chest, Lily thought it looked pretty.

There was silence between the two for a bit.

"...Are you still there?" Bow asked, softly. 

Lily sighed, crouched and leaning against her side of the wall. Despite her apprehension she replied, "...yeah, I'm still here."

A brief pause. "I'm sorry for my friend. She... well, I guess you heard."

The borrower nodded silently. She seemed the more excitable of the two, but the girl with the hat seemed the kind to... need to touch things. "...How do you know so much about me? About us?"

Bow chuckled. "There's stories that go around the corners of the Galactic Network. Niche message boards that discuss the possible existence of little people. Blog posts of encounters, sometimes from the borrowers themselves. It's... not publically known, and the vibe I get is people wanna keep it that way. But there's enough info out there that if you... are curious about these things, you can put two and two together. Nothing from this planet, though. This planet here has no idea..."

Lily's eyes widened. "Wait... are you from outer space?"

Bow giggled in response. "You could kinda say that."

"Whoa..."

Lily got to her feet, and slowly stepped around to the hole in the wall separating her from Bow.

The humanoid child was sat just outside her nook, the fabric of her dress blocking the borrower from view outside the two of them. As Lily looked upward, she saw her head was resting gently against the wall. She wasn't looking at her nook, rather she was just staring out toward the Metro, giving no indication that she was talking to someone like her. It was... surprisingly considerate.

Lily gently brushed the dress fabric.
