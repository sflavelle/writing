As I carefully carried the crumb away, I heard a small gasp from above. I glanced up, and froze.

The kid in purple was staring *right at me*, eyes wide as saucers.

I held a gasp of my own.

The two of us just... stood there, staring at each other.

Did... did she maybe think she was seeing things? Could I maybe escape from this?

Part of me wondered if I could perhaps get away with just staying frozen in place and pretending I was a doll or action figure or whatever it is humans have-

And then I heard her friend's voice. She was returning.

"Hey Hattie, thanks for waiting. I... uh? You all good?"

The frizzy-haired kid's head poked up into my view, as she watched her friend's blank stare. "Uhh, Hattie...?"

She followed her stare until she spotted me. "Oh! You found a borrower!"

Her voice shocked my brain back into gear, and I sprinted for my nook.

Immediately the shadow of a hand loomed over me as I rushed through the bushes-

Then the darker-skinned girl grabbed her friend by the wrist, pulling her hand away from me. "Hattie! Don't do that! You'll scare them!"

"Huh? Nooo, I just..."

I tossed the crumb up onto the ledge just by the hole in the mortar, scrambled up it myself, then grabbed the crumb and, in full view of the two girls, climbed up into the nook and disappeared from view.

As soon as I was away from their prying eyes, I dropped the crumb and collapsed against the inner wall, trembling. *That got WAY too close...*

The girls' voices filtered in through the hole. "I-I'm sorry Bow, I just... didn't know people came that small! I just wanted to look..."

"Sshhhhh!"

"What?"

"Listen, Hattie - we're not supposed to know they exist."

"Why? Is it some weird Earth conspiracy?"

"No, I, haven't you seen the internet?"

A moment of silence.

"...Oh, right. Hattie, they *are* people, trying to live. They're hidden in all kinds of places in the universe. But they *have* to  stay hidden. A place like down here, they might easily end up as cat food."

"Why are they down here then?"

"I don't think they got to have that choice."

"OH! What if we helped them find a new place to live so they can be happy and free?!"
