I was sneaking my way under the foliage when *they* arrived. Two human, or humanoid children approached the bushes, and climbed up to sit on the concrete lining it. They were drinking that stuff that makes their head cold, and enjoying it too. It's not my position to tell humans what to do with their lives but...

I had had to stop moving, going still beneath lush leaves and fighting the urge to peer up at them. They at least had their backs to me, talking to each other, but I wasn't going to take the chance that one of them might look my way at the wrong moment.

Children were unpredictable.

"See?" One of them was saying, showing the other something. "And you can press this one for the camera, or this one for the internet, or-"

"I don't use the internet," the second girl said. "The tide's always too low."

"The tide's too-- wh..." The first seemed nonplussed. "Hattie, you gotta get that computer upgraded! The internet's amazing! You're missing out on so many cat photos!"

I eyed the half-a-croissant left in the bush that was my bounty. If I could just get a few parts into my nook in the wall...

I hazarded a look above the leaves at the intruders.
