Hitman, but Hat Kid in AHiT levels (Hit Kid)

Forced 1hp

Stealth system for restricted areas, but being spotted triggers combat/fleeing of enemies

Multiple ways to eliminate targets (crushing, drowning, poisoning, accidents)

## Dead Bird Studios
- targets: Conductor + Grooves
- Additional objective: find 3 clues of attempted Hat Kid murder (hidden security tape, audio recording, defused bomb in basement, eyewitness dialogue)
- some things change depending on who won DBS (but can be changed via badge seller 'I thought grooves/conductor won?')
- possible special murders:
- Conductor: stabbed by prop knife switched for real knife, light fixture dropped on, electrocution via tampered megaphone, push from height via acting costume
- Grooves: crushed by Disco Ball, electrocution via tampered props, rigged explosion after Conductor argument, tampered homing fireworks, stabbed by Conductor
