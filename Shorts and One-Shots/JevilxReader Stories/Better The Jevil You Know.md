You come to, and find yourself suspended by your arms somewhere in a darkened room. Your head aches and your arms are numb.

You have no idea how you got here, and your recollection of the moments before ending up here is static, at least right now.

You shake a hand, trying to establish your surroundings. You succeed in brushing your body against whatever stone surface you're chained to, and establish that you've indeed been chained up.

Your head hurts. Actually, a lot of things hurt, now that you're more awake. Your eyes are wide open, but it's so dark in here that it's hard to make anything out.

You consider whether you want to call out for someone, but you decide against it. You don't wish to let whoever brought you here to know that you're awake and ready to be... what, interrogated? Tortured? You don't even know what you might have done to end up here.

Shit's strange.

You retreat into your thoughts...

----

The sound of doors sliding open, and footsteps getting louder, rouse you from your haze. You're not sure how much time has passed.

Blinking, you start to notice that a light source is nearing, a torch of some kind judging by the light it casts on the floor. Whoever it is is about to round the corner. Who is your captor?

The moment your captor appears, carrying a lit torch, you take him in, a stare of confusion on your features. This guy could give the Blue Man Group a run for their money. Everything you see is just blue. Like him. Inside and outside.

Wait, no, no time for thinking about songs.

He gets close enough to you to take notice of you, and you see from the light that you're in a cell, of a dungeon of some kind. How quaint.

He stops in front of the cell bars, his face takes in the sight of you, and you notice a raised eyebrow. He doesn't look *entirely* human to you, more... 'close enough' to human. It's hard to explain, but certainly uncanny.

He takes a breath, and begins to speak.

"Why hast thou chainedeth yourself upeth?"

You stare at him, expression flat. "...What."

Wait, that was not your voice. It sounded like someone had taken your voice and bitcrushed it, like you were speaking out of one of those Staples 'Easy' buttons or something.

Nonetheless... "Buddy. Pal. Are you *really* going to stand there and tell me that I have hung myself up in a dungeon just because?" Your eyes narrow at him.

"I didst not come hereth to argue," was the man's response, and you cringe at the abysmal attempt at Olde English. 

"Uh huh." You sigh, the sound also bitcrushed. This was *weird*. "I did not come here in the first place. You kidnapped *me*, I assume. I don't even know what I did to you."

"You knoweth full well, what led you here," the blue man said curtly, "or hast thou insanity taken your memorye as welleth, over these monthse?"

"Buddy, you're killing me with your speech," you huff, which causes you to swing lightly from the chains. You hear a quiet jingling from somewhere above your head. "I'm *sure* some time has passed between me waking up here and you coming by, but it *must* have been a day at most, not... months? Are you sure you're not mistaking me for someone else?"

Something seems to click in his head, and he narrows his eyes, taking you in with a more critical expression. Eyeing your face, your expressions, the way you hold yourself... Something seems off to him. You take a few breaths, trying your best not to flip out at him. It certainly *seems* like he's expecting you to be someone else.

A minute later, he steps back, hand to his chin in thought.

Then he turns, and leaves down the corridor, toward whatever exit he came from. The light dims around you.

"Hey! At least let me down!" You call out. "I'm already imprisoned, isn't this overkill?!"

He doesn't reply.

You are left to the darkness.

----

It's a while later, and you're back to zoning out in your thoughts.

You still have no idea why anyone has taken enough interest in you to chain you up. Hopefully Mr. Blue Guy, or *someone*, will come down to fill you in.

Because you'd really like some answers.

You become aware of voices coming your way this time. More than one. You recognise Blue Man, but there are others with him, it sounds like.

"...and you are sure it is not a trick?"

"I dost not knoweth. I knoweth that you visited him recently..."

"Well, Mr. Card, we'll do our best to help get to the bottom of this."

"And... ifeth he attacks you?"

"Pssh, we whooped him once! He'd have to be an IDIOT to take us on again!"

Okay, now you're confused. Whoever he's bringing to you this time, it definitely seems like they're all expecting someone else. You pick out a deep feminine voice and a light masculine one.

Then they come around the corner into your vision. There's three of them, not including the man from before.

Your eyes widen. *You know these three.*

Kris, Susie, and... Ralsei, was it? They're characters from that one game... Undergame. Or something.

Okay, that explains Blue Guy.

You take in their details, and note how Susie scowls at you, shifting her grip on the battle axe resting against her shoulder. How Kris seems to just examine you silently, his eyes hidden beneath his bangs. How Ralsei's eyes carefully scan your body.

There's silence for a few long moments.

"...You chained yourself up, Jevil?" Ralsei finally says, confusion on his features.

"Ugh," you begin, rolling your eyes, before you notice that the words also appear in a floating box in front of your eyes. What...? You start to reply, but-

"Didn't think you were into that," Kris says quietly, smirking. Susie snorts at the implied innuendo.

You shoot him a glare. "First of all, you'll have to forgive me, I have no idea who this 'Jevil' is. Second of all, again, *why would I chain myself up* if I've never been here before?! Ughhhhh." Frustrated, you bump your head lightly against the stone, leaning back, looking up at the ceiling of the dungeon.

As you adjust your head, whatever you've been wearing on your head shifts over your eyes, and you shake your head roughly to dislodge the thing. It falls from your head and lands on the stone floor, jingling as it moves.

A black and purple jester's hat.

You stare at it. You weren't wearing that before. You glance down at your body.

And that's when things start to click. You're wearing an outfit that is very clearly not yours, tightly fitting a soft round body, and your skin appears to be dark, unnatural. Between your legs, a thin, long tail peeks out at you.

This isn't your body. "W-wait. What happened to me? Who transformed me into this... clown devil?!" you demand of the group. Oh. Huh. 'Jester devil'. Jevil. That's... a decision that was made. That explains the getup.

"You've always looked like that, dude," Susie remarked. Kris simply continued to stare at you, and Ralsei and Blue share a look.

"Like hell I did!" You bark out. "I was human like, two days ago!"

Kris raises an eyebrow. Then he turns to Ralsei, who is approaching him.

"Kris, may I please have the key?" the goat monster asks. "I'd like to check something." With another glance at you, Kris nods and pulls a key from seemingly nowhere.

Ralsei takes the key, unlocks the cell door that has suddenly appeared between you, and steps in. You can do nothing but watch, as the three filter into the room, Blue Motherfucker deciding to stay back.

The healer lifts a hand, and you feel a ticklish sensation in your chest. You let out a huff, trying not to let it get to you as Ralsei does... whatever he needs to do, the other two protecting him from you.

A few uncomfortable moments later, Ralsei's hand falls, the magic in your chest dissipating, and his eyes widen. "That's not Jevil's SOUL in there, Mr. Rules Card. That's... a human SOUL."

You note that the dialogue box you've been seeing spells his name as 'Rouxls Kaard'. You roll your eyes. This man is ridiculous.

"Truly...?" Rouxls looked at you with a hint of confusion and hesitation. "Then... where *is* his souleth?"

God, *please* stop.

"If I had to guess..." Ralsei paused, thinking. "Jevil may have cast a bodyswap spell to escape, somehow."

What. Your eyes open wide. "So the guy who y'all think *I* am, is running around somewhere in *my* body?!" You scowl.

A look is shared between the group in front of you. "That's... a problem," Kris murmurs.

"Are you sure, pipsqueak?" Susie eyes Ralsei.

"...Positive," he says after a moment's thought. "Have you heard him repeating himself? His calls for 'chaos, chaos!' and the like?"

She looks at you with suspicion, seeming to think over what her companion has said about you.

Then she begins to approach you, shifting the axe properly into her hands.

Your stomach drops. "Wait, what the hell?" You cry out, beginning to panic. "Stop! Didn't you hear him? I'm innocent! I'm-- AHHH!"

Your eyes slam shut as she lifts the battle axe and takes a swing.

You hear a deep **thud**, one that reverberates through your body and --

Your chains snap, instantly cleaved in two.

Your eyes snap back open as you fall the 3 feet to the stony floor, your legs immediately buckling, and your arms searing with pain now that they aren't numb from being pulled upward for so long. You choke back a few deep breaths amidst a stream of curses, seeing the now broken chains around your wrists. "F-fuh... fuckin' hell... Nearly pissed myself, give a guy a fuckin' warning next time."

Susie allows herself a snort at the profanity sprouting from the chaos jester's mouth. "Okay, fine, yeah, that's not him. So if you're in *his* body, where's *your* body?"

You take a few deep breaths first, curling an aching arm around your - his - chest. "Well, he'll be--"

Your eyes widen. Wait. "He's... in another universe."

"...He's managed to escape to the Light World?!" Ralsei asks, a panic in his voice.

You shake your head, and slowly clamber to your feet. "World's a world, dude. No, I'm... separate, from all this. Living an entirely different life. None of this... magic, monsters. Not a thing. I'm from a different universe completely."

There was silence as you finally stood, and you looked at the jester hat on the ground. You reached out with a blue-grey, clawed hand to pick it up, looking it over. "Guess that means either my world's fucked, or... or he is, heh. Depending on where the magic went."

Kris frowned. "A conundrum."

"I wish I could help you more on finding him." You shook your head. 

"We'll find a way," you heard Ralsei say, and you are surprised when you suddenly feel his paw on your shoulder. You look up at them and smile. 

He turns to the group. "Well, looks like we've got a mystery to solve, hmm?" He grins.

"Sounds like a plan, squirt!" Susie grins, exposing her sharp teeth and clenching a fist. "The lil idiot won't know what hit him!"

She rushed out of the cell, and quickly vanished out of sight. "Susie, wait!" Ralsei called after her, following.

Kris started to follow after them, then paused, looking at you with a curious look to their expression.

Then they also turned and left, leaving you with Rouxls Kaard. What a name. What a stupid, stupid name. Now that the others were gone, you were unchained, and the cell door was still wide open, he watched you with some apprehension, as if you were going to show your true colors now that the Lightners were gone. You cocked your head to the side, raising an eyebrow. "I suppose you're going to lock me back up now, huh?"

He hesitated before answering. "I... don't knoweth." Though he stood in place, hands clasped behind back like some sort of butler, he seemed... conflicted. "It would indeedst appear thou art not the jester in SOULeth. However, I still feelst thy magic courseth through thy body."

Either Rouxls was being kind in ignoring your winces at his speech, or this happened all the time with him.

It took you a moment to process what he just said, and your eyes shot up to his, narrowing. "What? I have his magic? ...Why did you not tell them?"

"I couldst nay get a word in," was his response, a soft smile on his features.

"Hah." You chuckle, and sigh. Slowly, lifting your hands up, you approach the cell door. You watch as Rouxls gives you some distance. "Well, if it ah, 'pleaseth thee'," you allow yourself a smirk, "would you have any issue with me tagging along for a bit, so I can at least see whereever it is I've ended up?"

He hums in thought. You offer, "If you wish I can return here after the fact..."

He looks at you with a curious expression. "I wouldst normally need to asketh the king of such a favour..."

"Ah. Theocracy, huh? Fair. Can't say I didn't try--"

"Howevereth, the King of Spades is currently indisposed." With a sly smile, he steps aside, allowing you to exit. "Therefore, the decision is mineth to make. I will allow this of thee."

Your jaw opens, and you gape at him. "That's... putting a lot of trust in me." You carefully bow. "I'll remember this. Thank you."

Rouxls' smile this time is much more genuine. "I bid thee welcome to the Card Kingdom. What is thy name?"

----

You're allowed to swap the jester garb you woke up in for something more... 'normal' (normal for this world, at least), before you are guided in a tour of Card Castle. You learn that the Jevil situation is to do with him being corrupted by a 'Dark World', and that the forces of Dark and Light are out of balance, which is why Kris, Susie, and Ralsei are around, aiming to close something called a 'Dark Fountain' and stabilise the worlds that are being corrupted.

Rouxls, in return, learns your name, and you talk to him of the world in which you came from, of your modern technology and the pressures of modern society.

Which is how you ended up telling him, at a pause in his tour, as you both stood leaning over the castle walls, looking down into the appropriately named Castle Town, that now that the shock had worn off, this deviation in your life was... somewhat exciting. "I was, as I guess is the appropriate term here, a 'commoner'," you tell him, scratching a claw over your cheek. "People rely on the speed of machines quite a lot, and then just assume you can perform as quick and fast as one," you scowl. "It's ridiculous! They want you to be quality control, but you don't even get *half a second* to just scan it nowadays! It's all 'go go go' and 'faster, faster'! It destroys me. I *would* rather be back in that cell of yours than have to do that again."

You rest your head on your arms on the castle wall, letting out a sigh. "I get this is a change that isn't exactly wanted... for you guys and for my world, but... I'll make the most of it while I'm here, I suppose."

Rouxls nods, and leans forward against the wall with you. "...A thought occurs," he says, looking at you curiously. "Jevil was imprisonedeth so long ago, and I suspect this world may soon meeteth its end..."

"What?!" You gasp, turning toward him. "I-I'm sorry, I-"

He shakes his head. "Jevil is, of course his own problem, however... This... decay, exists due to the Dark Fountain bringing it into existence. This is my understanding, speaking to the Dark Prince Ralsei. ...Perhaps, this is a chance to reset. To let the expectations ebbeth away, let the darkness in our souls shape us into what we desire to be."

"...I'm not sure that I want to let the darkness in my soul win," you say quietly, almost to yourself.

"'Tis a different darkness," Rouxls clarifies. "We needst nay play the roles we were placed in. Thy opportunity strikes to be reborn, to nay be Y/N the Commoner, nay Jevil, Jester of Chaos. ...Nay Rouxls Kaard, the civil servant."

You glance at him. Is he having an identity crisis too?

A gentle breeze brushes through as you both watch the Card Kingdom pass you by.

----

Assuming Jevil's identity has come with benefits and drawbacks.

The body you now assumed being... rather a shock to see in full. 

The mirror that hung on the far side of your temporary quarters drew up to about twice your size. And if you were concerned about the clothing and the skin colour and the tail, the face that stared back at you was a shock to the system.

You befitted the name 'Jevil' for sure. 

Pudgy cheeks and an impish mouth and fangs hung beneath pointed crosses painted around the eyes, like a black four-pointed star. (Weren't save points in the other game 'stars' in the same way?) Your eyes, to go with them, were black like something demonic, with golden irises that almost glowed in contrast. 

The purple-blue skin was ever so slightly fuzzy, very short fur growing. It felt... strangely pleasant to the touch, as did the chubbiness on your new frame, evidence of the jester's previous lavish life in the castle. You wondered if it was because of his curvature that his outfit, and indeed anything you could find to wear, was so... form-fitting.

You had worn his outfit again briefly, trying to understand *him* through it. The vest that covered most of his frame had patterning around the middle that gave you the impression of royalty, or one of those weird hunting party guys on horses. It was a little tight around the belly - was that normal or had he somehow managed to put *on* some pounds in captivity?

His ruff and his shoes were the only things that broke from his black-and-purple scheme. They stood out completely from the rest of the outfit, with bright green and orange segments on the ruff, and the same green on his footwear. It was...

Well, it was something. 

You admittedly appreciated the plain black cowl for warmth, though. 

Despite discovering that you look like some kind of devil doll, and those in the Castle who had witnessed Jevil's downfall turning to run whenever they crossed paths with you, you found you didn't mind the body so much. 

No, your desire was to learn magic. Having grown up in a world without it, and the constant hum of energy coursing through your body left you wanting an outlet, wanting to experiment.

Which is how you would find yourself in the archives for most of your free time, sat at a table quietly, a stack of history and theory books about magic by your side, and occasionally trying to figure out some basic spells - casting light, or healing, or something. 

It wasn't working out yet, but you wanted to be able to do it at least once, even if it wasn't going to follow you once you were reunited with your own body.

----

A few weeks later, there is a knock at the door to your quarters. You have been summoned to the front of the castle, told that the Lightners have returned with news for you.

You wear Jevil's jester getup today, assuming it is time to get back to your old life, and to put the chaotic soul back in his cell. 

When you arrive, Rouxls is being regaled by Ralsei with tales of the team's adventures while Kris and Susie stand behind him quietly (a little awkwardly, in Susie's case). They notice you immediately as you enter, and they examine you with some concern as you walk up to them. "Hello, hello!" you call, slightly absently - you miss how those present tense up at the repetition. "Great to see you all again. Travelling well?"

Ralsei nods, but there's an expression of concern and reluctance on his face. "Yes! Uh, the corruption from the Dark World's influence has been stopped! We've... um, sealed the Fountain, and nothing should come through to torment this world again!"

"Oh! Well, that's excellent news, isn't it! The day will grace this kingdom once more, will it not?"

"Indeed!" Ralsei allowed a smile. 

Kris stepped toward you, and you turned to face him. His expression was unreadable. "Would you like the good news or the bad news first?" He asked.

You thought for a moment, tapping your foot on the floor. "I've always been of the opinion that receiving the good news first will temper the bad news."

Kris nodded. With a brief glance toward the others, the Lightner launched into it. "We found you. Your body, I mean."

"Oh! Amazing!" You gaped. You didn't even know they could *reach* your reality. "And was the little bastard pretending to be me?"

"Not really 'pretending'," Susie chuckled, but her expression was similarly strange. "But yeah. Don't worry, that Jevil is history now."

"Nice! Good work!" You grinned at them. "Thank you for saving me from a world of embarrassment. I can only imagine what he could have done in my body. Now, what's the bad news?"

The foyer was silent. There were grim looks on the groups' faces, as they struggled to figure out how to break the news. Rouxls held a hand to his mouth, eyes wide, shocked. 

"...Guys...?"

They watched as you visibly processed what they told you. 

Jevil was in your body. Now Jevil was gone, and your body was safe.

That was how it worked! Right?

Right...? Because the alternative would be...

That your body was...

Your eyes slowly widened, and ever so slowly you turned in place toward Ralsei. By the time you faced him completely, there was a deep fear in your eyes. 

He faced you for a tense, long moment, but eventually his gaze broke away from you and, uncomfortable, he whispered three words that broke you, struck a sharp pain in your soul. 

"I'm sorry, Y/N."

A choked gasp forced its way from your open mouth. 

No.

He hadn't.

Jevil couldn't have gotten you killed. 

He just couldn't have.

You stood silently for a long moment, just staring off into space. 

The life you had lived before, as *yourself*, was over. 

Because some idiot jester had to keep fucking around, now you were stuck in *this* body forever.

After what felt like minutes of silence, you seemed to unfreeze, and the words started to tumble out. "...I... Fuck, man. That's not- ...Why would he do that? Why- god, my friends- What about my roommate?! They're- Fucking Jevil- I had a whole life- Why does shit never want to work out for- FUCKING **JEVIL!**"

Somewhere in the midst of your rambling, subconsciously, a scythe had fizzled into existence in your hands, and your friends ducked out of the way as you swung it about in your raving. The buzz of Jevil's magic within you surged through your palms into the blade, and as you swung the blade down, punctuating your final exclamation, you felt it catch on *nothing*, then slice.

As the blade cut through the air, a *hole* in the space in front of you opened, a window into another world.

A window into *your* world.

Interrupted by the sight, you blankly stared at the view on the other side.

Then, you moved to wedge the scythe into the hole, such that it shouldn't close, then, the moment over, you trembled and slowly fell to your knees.

There you were.

What was left of your own body, that was.

It seemed you had been shot to death, somewhere in the alleyway of a city. Blood had dried around your chest.

Barely thinking, you stumbled to your feet and approached the portal, the others approaching behind. You climbed through, noting that Rouxls did as well, and you stared at your own glassy expression.

This was an awful sight to see. You reached out slowly, with your clawed hands, to carefully close the human body's eyelids.

And then, surrounded by your new monster friends (and Kris), you began to sob uncontrollably, mourning the death of your old life.

----

The last day of your second life began with a request from Kris to meet you in a clearing in the Crimson Forest.

At midnight.

If you weren't certain, two months into your life as Jevil, that the wilderness was safe *enough* for liaisons like this, you would have thought that Kris had some ulterior motive. Sure, he was just slightly creepy in that odd teenager way, and he had those red eyes (but only sometimes, which still eluded you), but he was - y'know - the hero of this story you were living in. Plus, he and his friends from the Light World had been ever-so-helpful in figuring yourself out.

And that was why you traversed quietly through the forest paths, a cowl keeping you warm, the jester outfit underneath. A ball of light held in your left hand lit the path ahead.

It was kind of peaceful, if you had to be honest with yourself.

As you entered the clearing where you were to meet, you pulsed more magic into the orb briefly, its glow brightening and illuminating the area as you glanced around.

You were the first to arrive, it seemed.

You leaned against a nearby tree and waited.

It was a few minutes before, though nobody appeared in your field of vision, a familiar voice said gently, *right into your ear*, "There's something I've been meaning to ask."

You flinched away, turning your head to see Kris standing right next to where you had been, shit-eating grin on his face. You growled in frustration. "Jesus, Kris, can you *ever* be a normal human being?"

"Well, so, that's the thing." You noted his eyes were red again tonight. "So you're a real person, right?"

You stared at him. "...rrrriiiight...?"

(You noted to yourself that Kris was already speaking more than he usually does.)

"Right. So." He approached you slowly, his intense gaze boring into you. "How do I become part of this world?"

You blinked. Then again. "...You're... right here."

"No, *Kris* is here," Kris said. "*I'm* not."

Your eyes darted back and forth, taking in Kris's details. Your utter confusion must have shown on your face, as Kris continued, "I mean, I know Kris is the Angel's Vessel n' all but I mean-- have you even *played* Deltarune?"

*Deltarune.*

This wasn't *Kris* talking to you. This was the *Angel*, the *Player* behind Kris, currently controlling him.

And they were asking you... how to get *into* the game's world?!

"I uh." You closed your eyes and pressed your gloved hands into your face. "I didn't really ask to be here in the first place. You know that."

"Yeah, yeah." Now 'Kris' was pushing into your personal space. You gave him a gentle push away. "I bet that's just the *lore* reason. I mean look at you! You can do magic and you're friends with the gang for being *you*! *I* wanna be friends with them too! I mean we know Jevil would never act like that!"

"The fuck?" You were offended by how this person seemed to assume that you just wrote yourself into the story to be part of Deltarune's world. You jabbed a clawed finger into Kris's armour. "The fuck is your problem? I didn't ask for Jevil to do what he did. I didn't ask to *lose my body* to be here! Have I dreamed of being in a video game world, sure! I've never wanted to *die* to make that happen!"

The Player was unperturbed. Through Kris they spoke quietly, "Well, I think it's unfair, you know? And this has been some nice 'additional content' or whatever, but I think if I'm not allowed to be part of this world--"

Suddenly, 'Kris' withdrew his sword from its scabbard, and you were too late to react - you found yourself shivering in fear, the point of the sword poised just beneath your chin. 

'Kris' smirked, finishing the statement. "... I think you don't get to be either."

Before he could act (and not ACT), you reached for the magic surging through you, warping a few steps away as the Player thrust the sword upward. *That would have gone through your head*, you realised in shock.

*He actually wanted to kill you.*

Anger and adrenaline surged through you. "Let Kris go," you snarled, conjuring up a few spade bullets, letting them just hover in place in front of you. "They don't deserve to be part of this." For additional protection, you reached out your hand and summoned Jevil's blade to your side.

At least, that was your intent.

"Oh," the Vessel murmured calmly, a smug smile on their face. "Perhaps looking for this?"

Letting the sword hang loosely from their hand, they reached behind themselves with the other, and pulled out -- *they had your blade*. When did that happen?

The scythe went away again, and the Vessel began to charge at you, holding Kris's sword in both hands. You launched your idle bullets at him before warping again, to the opposite side of the clearing. You could already tell you needed to stop using that - maybe it was because you had *just* learned to use that aspect of your magic, but it was using up more of your reserves than you expected. You flung more bullets in his direction in an attempt to slow him down...

And then turned tail and fled through the dark forest, 'Kris' in hot pursuit.

You had to reach Castle Town, at least. Would the Player still try to kill you if you had an audience? Could you wake anyone up? For perhaps the first time you bemoaned Jevil's form's lack of stamina--

**[E N O U G H.]**

The world around you and 'Kris' went black, and both of you were forced to a stop. The echo of the booming voice that had suddenly spoke to them reverberated around them.

**[JESTER. YOUR STORY ENDED LONG AGO.]**

You eyed 'Kris', gesturing rudely at him. Speaking to whereever this voice was coming from, you began, "I am *not* Jevil--"

**[I DO NOT PARTICULARLY CARE.]**

"...Rude."

**[ANGEL.]**

The Vessel turned, and you followed to see that a dark, imposing knight figure had appeared in this void with you, staring impassively at you with it's weapon drawn, but not ready to strike. And behind them...

Very faint shapes of something massive, something ominous, loomed over the three of you. It felt like it should have been invisible, but its aura in this moment or... *something*... was so imposing at that moment. You got the impression that *this* was the booming voice speaking to you.

**[YOUR CONNECTION TO THIS WORLD IS TEMPORARY.]**

**[PROLONGING IT BY INDULGING IN THESE FANTASIES WILL NOT BE TOLERATED.]**

**[THIS DETOUR IS HEREBY OVER.]**

**[I WILL ALLOW YOU TO CONTINUE ON ONE CONDITION.]**

In a flash, Jevil's scythe once again appeared in the Vessel's hand.

**[E R A D I C A T E  H I M.]**

...

Slowly, silently, Kris, the Vessel, turned toward you.

"Kris."

He took one step toward you.

"You're allowed to walk away, dude."

And another.

You tried to take a step back - but you couldn't move. 

Something was controlling you, keeping you in place. 

You could only watch in growing terror as the Player approached.

**[YOU MISUNDERSTAND.]**

Kris lifted the blade up, readying it for a swing.

**[THIS IS NOT THE ANGEL'S CHOICE TO MAKE.]**

***[IT IS MINE.]***

The blade came down, slicing through your chest.

There was an instant of hot pain, agony like you had never felt--

And then-

Nothing.

...

* The Devilsknife has gone quiet.

...

...

----

"......"

"...did... ...fr...?"

Your world was a near impenetrable fog, your self... aware of almost nothing. You could not tell the passage of time, how long you had been here. 

Your prison was dark and void, formless... much like yourself. Occasionally you felt a sense of being held, a warmth, a comfort - even if you were in no shape to process those feelings.

After what might have felt like an eternity existing without consciousness, soon you began to feel, to take shape once more. You were still trapped within your mind, but gradually your mind began to awaken and dream once more.

At first your dreams were a blur, more colors and concepts, vague feelings than something substantial. But as the days progressed your dreams became more 'real', more solid. Your brain, your mind was able to start forming objects and structures once more.

In one such dream, you were exploring a gigantified version of your home, roaming your cluttered computer desk like some kind of borrower. Stepping around Stream Decks and controllers and cables, you were exploring as a tiny version of yourself, and it was kind of exhilarating--

"How fun, fun!"

Your head snapped up, as a shadow loomed over you.

Jevil, sat in your chair, many times larger than you, smiled down at you. "Is this the kind of adventures humans like you dream of? I daresay it's rather cute~."

You blinked. "I'm...?" You shook your head. "Of- of course I must be dreaming. I'm small and--" You paused, eyes narrowing. "...Hang on... Something happened. Didn't it?"

"Indeed, indeed!" He beamed. "And now we are both truly free, free of the puppetmaster who sought to play his games~!" He looked especially pleased about this fact.

"...Okay, but how?" You leaned against the handle of a Dualsense controller. "Because I think I remember you died in *my* body... unless I finally *am* succumbing to the madness everyone thought you had."

"Ueeheehee! You're funny, little lightner." A large hand descended toward you, and despite your attempt at brushing him away, he picked you up with ease, holding you in his palm. "You see, young Kris and I had so much fun with our numbers game that I decided to join him! By placing my soul in the prize that I bestowed upon him, I could be as free as I desired, and the King and the Puppetmaster would be none-the-wiser, none-the-wiser!" He grinned, fanged teeth visible. "I simply needed someone to take my place~!"

You crossed your arms, frowning. "Well, you got me, I'm a sucker. So why are you bringing me with you now...?"

A gentle claw brushed over your head, but Jevil didn't answer immediately. His smile dimmed slightly as he decided how best to answer your query. "...The puppetmaster... He was the one to reveal the nature of our world to me, the nature of the game we were all pawns in. And while, yes yes, perhaps my sanity has been damaged by the revelation, in my cell I truly was free, free from the puppet master's strings!"

He held you more gently, cradling you in his palm while continuing his idle petting. "But playing with Kris, struggling with his own control... And then seeing you, attempting to build a new life for me - I could see you were kind, and curious, and I knew *he* would take notice eventually."

He sighed, and smiled wistfully. "I had hoped to save us both in a much less painful manner, but once he forced Kris's possessor to take action, I had to work quickly to get us both out of there... And now... we truly are both free from those strings that bound us!" He lit up once more, and Jevil pressed you against his chest with both hands.

He was soft, warm; the velvet of his outfit brushing lightly against your exposed skin. The lack of a heartbeat was strange and not something you had really noticed when you had been in his body, but this was also a dream, so you weren't sure if that was real or not. You relaxed into him, wondering whether monster souls had a heartbeat. Why would they?

You shook your head to loosen the thought from your mind. It wasn't important right now. "That.. makes a bit of sense, but doesn't quite answer my question. You coulda left me for-- Oh my god, I died," you said, cutting yourself off as the memory finally resurfaced of Kris, possessed, standing before you with a scythe you yourself wielded briefly.

"*You*, your soul, is quite safe with me!" Jevil chirped up.

You blinked. "Y- ...You absorbed my soul?"

The jester shook his head. "I would do no such thing! How could you know of monsters and souls, lightner?" He lifted you away from him again and stared down at you, cheekily poking at you with a gentle claw. "Your world was quite boring, bereft of magic from what I had seen!"

You squirmed under his touch. Well... As if he didn't know. May as well say it. "I... have a bit of an idea of how some things work from, ah, games involving your world?"

Jevil stopped, squinting down at you suspiciously.

Then, with a poof and a popping noise, you found yourself at your full size, and both of you crashed to the floor. After a moment to get your bearings, you found that you were actually *taller* than the jester, his face level with your neck.

"I want to be clear," you stressed as you both sat on the ground facing each other in this dream version of your living room. "I'm not the 'puppetmaster' or affiliated with him. But my understanding is that the thing that controls Kris is someone who *literally* sees the world as a game. Now, whether this puppermaster-- *puppetmaster*, god, English is hard sometimes- whether he's pulling their strings as well, I don't know. But... well, I saw what you saw. Y'know, when I was you." You leaned in, resting a hand on his shoulder. "People speaking to me, whose words I saw on the edge of my vision. The same words telling me I restored HP when I ate. The everpresent feeling of being watched from all angles, whenever Kris was around with those red eyes..."

"I *understand* how you must have felt. The bastard was *right*, and nobody else saw it." You sighed, muttered "ah, fuck it", and embraced him. "And from the sounds of things, now we are rid of all that. So if we are sticking together, where does that leave us?"

Jevil's cheeks flushed, his smile dropping in surprise - not at all expecting this soul he had rescued to be suddenly hugging him - realising that he had missed being touched, from all his time being 'free' in the cell he had called his own. The validation, the relief that this human had seen and understood what he had gone through, when no one else had any idea what he was talking about... except perhaps Kris, from what this soul had said.

A small smile returned to his lips. "I have rescued us to a new world! Some time has passed since you have been among the living, and I enlisted the help of the dark Prince in secret to create a vessel for your soul! Being a monster vessel, it requires a source of magic, and well, well, I have plenty to spare! And now we can explore this new realm we have found once you fully reawaken! How does that sound?"

The implication took a moment to sink in. "Wait, you and Ralsei made me a body again? You... risked being caught to help me? Why...?"

"Why not!" He beamed and got to his feet, bouncing happily about the room. "I can do anything! That foolish man can't find me, not without poor Kris! And besides..."

He turned to you once more, good smile turning impish.

"What's wrong with a little chaos, chaos?" He giggled, and pranced over to you, petting you on the head. "For now, my friend, you should rest. Our new world won't go anywhere while you finish recovering. And if you should need accompaniment while you dream, Jevil is not far away~!"

He beamed, bouncing on his feet into the next room and out of sight.

When you got up and looked, he was nowhere to be found.
