You come to, and find yourself suspended by your arms somewhere in a darkened room. Your head aches and your arms are numb.

You have no idea how you got here, and your recollection of the moments before ending up here is static, at least right now.

You shake a hand, trying to establish your surroundings. You succeed in brushing your body against whatever stone surface you're chained to, and establish that you've indeed been chained up.

Your head hurts. Actually, a lot of things hurt, now that you're more awake. Your eyes are wide open, but it's so dark in here that it's hard to make anything out.

You consider whether you want to call out for someone, but you decide against it. You don't wish to let whoever brought you here to know that you're awake and ready to be... what, interrogated? Tortured? You don't even know what you might have done to end up here.

Shit's strange.

You retreat into your thoughts...

----

The sound of doors sliding open, and footsteps getting louder, rouse you from your haze. You're not sure how much time has passed.

Blinking, you start to notice that a light source is nearing, a torch of some kind judging by the light it casts on the floor. Whoever it is is about to round the corner. Who is your captor?

The moment your captor appears, carrying a lit torch, you take him in, a stare of confusion on your features. This guy could give the Blue Man Group a run for their money. Everything you see is just blue. Like him. Inside and outside.

Wait, no, no time for thinking about songs.

He gets close enough to you to take notice of you, and you see from the light that you're in a cell, of a dungeon of some kind. How quaint.

He stops in front of the cell bars, his face takes in the sight of you, and you notice a raised eyebrow. He doesn't look *entirely* human to you, more... 'close enough' to human. It's hard to explain, but certainly uncanny.

He takes a breath, and begins to speak.

"Why hast thou chainedeth yourself upeth?"

You stare at him, expression flat. "...What."

Wait, that was not your voice. It sounded like someone had taken your voice and bitcrushed it, like you were speaking out of one of those Staples 'Easy' buttons or something.

Nonetheless... "Buddy. Pal. Are you *really* going to stand there and tell me that I have hung myself up in a dungeon just because?" Your eyes narrow at him.

"I didst not come hereth to argue," was the man's response, and you cringe at the abysmal attempt at Olde English. 

"Uh huh." You sigh, the sound also bitcrushed. This was *weird*. "I did not come here in the first place. You kidnapped *me*, I assume. I don't even know what I did to you."

"You knoweth full well, what led you here," the blue man said curtly, "or hast thou insanity taken your memorye as welleth, over these monthse?"

"Buddy, you're killing me with your speech," you huff, which causes you to swing lightly from the chains. You hear a quiet jingling from somewhere above your head. "I'm *sure* some time has passed between me waking up here and you coming by, but it *must* have been a day at most, not... months? Are you sure you're not mistaking me for someone else?"

Something seems to click in his head, and he narrows his eyes, taking you in with a more critical expression. Eyeing your face, your expressions, the way you hold yourself... Something seems off to him. You take a few breaths, trying your best not to flip out at him. It certainly *seems* like he's expecting you to be someone else.

A minute later, he steps back, hand to his chin in thought.

Then he turns, and leaves down the corridor, toward whatever exit he came from. The light dims around you.

"Hey! At least let me down!" You call out. "I'm already imprisoned, isn't this overkill?!"

He doesn't reply.

You are left to the darkness.

----

It's a while later, and you're back to zoning out in your thoughts.

You still have no idea why anyone has taken enough interest in you to chain you up. Hopefully Mr. Blue Guy, or *someone*, will come down to fill you in.

Because you'd really like some answers.

You become aware of voices coming your way this time. More than one. You recognise Blue Man, but there are others with him, it sounds like.

"...and you are sure it is not a trick?"

"I dost not knoweth. I knoweth that you visited him recently..."

"Well, Mr. Card, we'll do our best to help get to the bottom of this."

"And... ifeth he attacks you?"

"Pssh, we whooped him once! He'd have to be an IDIOT to take us on again!"

Okay, now you're confused. Whoever he's bringing to you this time, it definitely seems like they're all expecting someone else. You pick out a deep feminine voice and a light masculine one.

Then they come around the corner into your vision. There's three of them, not including the man from before.

Your eyes widen. *You know these three.*

Kris, Susie, and... Ralsei, was it? They're characters from that one game... Undergame. Or something. Undertale? No, the newer one. Uhhh... it'll come to you eventually.

Okay, that explains Blue Guy. They're all, bar Kris, monsters. These three were Lightners (even if Ralsei was a Darkner, but the difference was escaping you at the moment).

You take in their details, and note how Susie scowls at you, shifting her grip on the battle axe resting against her shoulder. How Kris seems to just examine you silently, his eyes hidden beneath his bangs. How Ralsei's eyes carefully scan your body.

There's silence for a few long moments.

"...You chained yourself up, Jevil?" Ralsei finally says, confusion on his features.

"Ugh," you begin, rolling your eyes, before you notice that the words also appear in a floating box in front of your eyes. What...? You start to reply, but-

"Didn't think you were into that," Kris says quietly, smirking. Susie snorts at the implied innuendo.

You shoot him a glare. "First of all, you'll have to forgive me, I have no idea who this 'Jevil' is. Second of all, again, *why would I chain myself up* if I've never been here before?! Ughhhhh." Frustrated, you bump your head lightly against the stone, leaning back, looking up at the ceiling of the dungeon.

As you adjust your head, whatever you've been wearing on your head shifts over your eyes, and you shake your head roughly to dislodge the thing. It falls from your head and lands on the stone floor, jingling as it moves.

A black and purple jester's hat.

You stare at it. You weren't wearing that before. You glance down at your body.

And that's when things start to click. You're wearing an outfit that is very clearly not yours, tightly fitting a soft round body, and your skin appears to be dark, unnatural. Between your legs, a thin, long tail peeks out at you.

This isn't your body. "W-wait. What happened to me? Who transformed me into this... clown devil?!" you demand of the group.

Oh. Huh. 'Jester devil'. Jevil. That's... how he got his name, you supposed. *That* was a decision that was made. That explains the getup.

"You've always looked like that, dude," Susie remarked with a slightly confused look. Kris simply continued to stare at you, and Ralsei and Blue share a look.

"Like hell I did!" You bark out. "I was human like, two days ago!"

Kris raises an eyebrow. Then he turns to Ralsei, who is approaching him.

"Kris, may I please have the key?" the goat monster asks. "I'd like to check something." With another glance at you, Kris nods and pulls a key from seemingly nowhere.

Ralsei takes the key, unlocks the cell door that has suddenly appeared between you, and steps in. You can do nothing but watch, as the three filter into the room, Blue Motherfucker deciding to stay back.

There's a slight pause, as your visitors seem to expect something to happen - glancing about awkwardly at the plain cell. "Hey, uhhh - where's your thing?" Susie asks very eloquently.

"...my *thing*," you deadpanned.

"You know! The, the... merry-go-round thing! You had a whole thing going here! Now it's all boring."

"I'm sorry to disappoint." You rolled your eyes, noticing Ralsei stepping closer.

The healer lifts a hand, and you feel a ticklish sensation in your chest. You let out a huff, trying not to let it get to you as Ralsei does... whatever he needs to do, the other two protecting him from you.

A few uncomfortable moments later, Ralsei's hand falls, the magic in your chest dissipating, and his eyes widen. "That's not Jevil's SOUL in there, Mr. Rules Card. That's... a human SOUL."

You note that the dialogue box you've been seeing spells his name as 'Rouxls Kaard'. You roll your eyes. This man is ridiculous.

"Truly...?" Rouxls looked at you with a hint of confusion and hesitation. "Then... where *is* his souleth?"

God, *please* stop.

"If I had to guess..." Ralsei paused, thinking. "Jevil may have cast a bodyswap spell to escape, somehow. We saw what he was capable of before..."

What. Your eyes open wide. "So the guy who y'all think *I* am, is running around somewhere in *my* body?!" You scowl.

A look is shared between the group in front of you. "That's... a problem," Kris murmurs.

"Are you sure, pipsqueak?" Susie eyes Ralsei.

"...Positive," he says after a moment's thought. "Have you heard him repeating himself? His calls for 'chaos, chaos!' and the like?"

She looks at you with suspicion, seeming to think over what her companion has said about you.

Then she begins to approach you, shifting the axe properly into her hands.

Your stomach drops. "Wait, what the hell?" You cry out, beginning to panic. "Stop! Didn't you hear him? I'm innocent! I'm-- AHHH!"

Your eyes slam shut as she lifts the battle axe and takes a swing.

You hear a deep **thud**, one that reverberates through your body as the blade lodges into the wall and --

Your chains snap, instantly cleaved in two.

Your eyes snap back open as you fall the 3 feet to the stony floor, your legs immediately buckling, and your arms searing with pain now that they aren't numb from being pulled upward for so long. You crumple down onto your hands and knees, choking back a few deep breaths amidst a stream of curses, seeing the now broken chains around your wrists. "F-fuh... fuckin' hell... Nearly pissed myself, give a guy a fuckin' warning next time."

Susie allows herself a snort at the profanity sprouting from the chaos jester's mouth. "Okay, fine, yeah, that's not him. So squirt, if you're in *his* body, where's *your* body?"

You take a few deep breaths first, curling an aching arm around your - his - chest. "Well, he'll be--"

Your eyes widen. Wait. "He's... in another universe."

"...He's managed to escape to the Light World?!" Ralsei asks, a panic in his voice.

You shake your head, and slowly clamber to your feet, trembling from weakness. "World's a world, dude. No, I'm... separate, from all this. Living an entirely different life. None of this... magic, monsters. Not a thing. I'm from a different universe completely."

There was silence as you finally stood, and you looked at the jester hat on the ground. You reached out with a blue-grey, clawed hand to pick it up, looking it over. "Guess that means either my world's fucked, or... or he is, heh. Depending on where the magic went."

Kris frowned. "A conundrum."

"I wish I could help you more on finding him." You shook your head. 

"We'll find a way," you heard Ralsei say, and you are surprised when you suddenly feel his paw on your shoulder. You look up at them and smile. 

He turns to the group. "Well, looks like we've got a mystery to solve, hmm?" He grins.

"Sounds like a plan, squirt!" Susie grins, exposing her sharp teeth and clenching a fist. "The idiot won't know what hit him!"

She rushed out of the cell, and quickly vanished out of sight. "Susie, wait!" Ralsei called after her, following.

Kris started to follow after them, then paused, looking at you with a curious look to their expression.

Their red eyes boring into you for a few seconds too long.

Then they also turned and left, leaving you with Rouxls Kaard. What a name. What a stupid, stupid name. Now that the others were gone, you were unchained, and the cell door was still wide open, he watched you with some apprehension, as if you were going to show your true colors now that the Lightners were gone. You cocked your head to the side, raising an eyebrow. "I suppose you're going to lock me back up now, huh?"

He hesitated before answering. "I... don't knoweth." Though he stood in place, hands clasped behind back like some sort of butler, he seemed... conflicted. "It would indeedst appear thou art not the jester in SOULeth. However, I still feelst thy magic courseth through thy body."

Either Rouxls was being kind in ignoring your winces at his speech, or this happened all the time with him.

It took you a moment to process what he just said, and your eyes shot up to his, narrowing. "What? I have this 'Jevil' fellow's magic? ...Why did you not tell them?"

"I couldst nay get a word in," was his response, a sly smile on his features.

"Hah." You chuckle, and sigh. Slowly, lifting your hands up, you approach the cell door. You watch as Rouxls gives you some distance. "Well, if it ah, 'pleaseth thee'," you allow yourself a smirk, "would you have any issue with me tagging along for a bit, so I can at least see whereever it is I've ended up?"

He hums in thought. You offer, "If you wish I can return here after the fact..."

He looks at you with a curious expression. "I wouldst normally need to asketh the king of such a favour..."

"Ah. Theocracy, huh? Fair. Can't say I didn't try--"

"Howevereth, the King of Spades is currently indisposed, having been defeated in battle." With a sly smile, he steps aside, allowing you to exit. "Therefore, the decision is mineth to make. I shalt allow this of thee."

Your jaw opens, and you gape at him. "That's... putting a lot of trust in me." You carefully bow. "I'll remember this. Thank you."

Rouxls' smile this time is much more genuine. "I bid thee welcome to the Card Kingdom. What is thy name?"

----

You're allowed to swap the jester garb you woke up in for something more... 'normal' (normal for this world, at least), before you are guided in a tour of Card Castle. 

You learn that the Jevil situation is to do with him being corrupted by a 'Dark World', and that the forces of Dark and Light are out of balance, which is why Kris, Susie, and Ralsei are around, aiming to close something called a 'Dark Fountain' and stabilise the worlds that are being corrupted. Jevil *had* been corrupted in some manner and imprisoned, and then the Lightners had nearly freed him when investigating the castle some time ago... but then that had been it. 

Until now, seemingly.

Rouxls, in return, learns your name, and you talk to him of the world in which you came from, of your modern technology and the pressures of modern society.

Which is how you ended up telling him, at a pause in his tour, as you both stood leaning over the castle walls, looking down into the appropriately named Castle Town, that now that the shock had worn off, this deviation in your life was... somewhat exciting. 

"I was, as I guess is the appropriate term here, a 'commoner'," you tell him, scratching a claw over your cheek. "People rely on the speed of machines quite a lot, and then just assume you can perform as quick and fast as one," you scowl. "It's ridiculous! They want you to be quality control, but you don't even get *half a second* to just scan it nowadays! It's all 'go go go' and 'faster, faster'! It destroys me. I *would* rather be back in that cell of yours than have to do that again."

You rest your head on your arms on the castle wall, letting out a sigh. "I get this is a change that isn't exactly wanted... for you guys and for my world, but... I'll make the most of it while I'm here, I suppose."

Rouxls nods, and leans forward against the wall with you. "...A thought occurs," he says, looking at you curiously. "Jevil was imprisonedeth so long ago, and I suspect this world may soon meeteth its end..."

"What?!" You gasp, turning toward him. "I-I'm sorry, I-"

He shakes his head. "Jevil is, of course his own problem, however... This... decay, exists due to the Dark Fountain bringing it into existence. Someone has brought the Dark here. ...This is my understanding, speaking to the Dark Prince Ralsei. ...Perhaps, this is a chance to reset. To let the expectations ebbeth away, let the darkness in our souls shape us into what we desire to be."

"...I'm not sure that I want to let the darkness in my soul win," you say quietly, almost to yourself.

"'Tis a different darkness," Rouxls clarifies. "We needst nay play the roles we were placed in. Thy opportunity strikes to be reborn, to nay be Y/N the Commoner, nay Jevil, Jester of Chaos."

You glance at him. You think on what he said. And you lay your head on your arms, leaning forward on the castle walls.

A gentle breeze brushes through as you both watch the Card Kingdom pass you by.

----

Assuming Jevil's identity has come with benefits and drawbacks.

The body you now assumed being... rather a shock to see in full. 

The mirror that hung on the far side of your temporary quarters drew up to about twice your size. And if you were concerned about the clothing and the skin colour and the tail, the face that stared back at you was a shock to the system.

You befitted the name 'Jevil' for sure. 

Pudgy cheeks and an impish mouth and fangs hung beneath pointed crosses painted around the eyes, like a black four-pointed star. (Weren't save points in the other game 'stars' in the same way?) Your eyes, to go with them, were black like something demonic, with golden irises that almost glowed in contrast. 

The purple-blue skin was ever so slightly fuzzy, very short fur growing. It felt... strangely pleasant to the touch, as did the chubbiness on your new frame, evidence of the jester's previous lavish life in the castle. You wondered if it was because of his curvature that his outfit, and indeed anything you could find to wear, was so... form-fitting.

You had worn his outfit again briefly, trying to understand *him* through it. The vest that covered most of his frame had patterning around the middle that gave you the impression of royalty, or one of those weird hunting party guys on horses. 

His ruff and his shoes were the only things that broke from his black-and-purple scheme. They stood out completely from the rest of the outfit, with bright green and orange segments on the ruff, and the same green on his footwear. It was...

Well, it was something. 

You admittedly appreciated the plain black cowl worn as a cape for warmth, though. 

Despite discovering that you look like some kind of devil doll, and those in the Castle who had witnessed Jevil's downfall turning to run whenever they crossed paths with you, you found you didn't mind the body so much. You missed yours of course, but... this would do.

No, your desire was to learn magic. Having grown up in a world without it, and the constant hum of energy coursing through your body left you wanting an outlet, wanting to experiment... wanting to harness this energy.

Which is how you would find yourself in the archives for most of your free time, sat at a table quietly, a stack of history and theory books about magic by your side, and occasionally trying to figure out some basic spells - casting light, or healing, or something. 

It wasn't working out yet - as it turned out, trying to learn techniques that were simply innate ability for monsters was a *lot* of trial and error... or almost entirely error in your case. Just because the body you currently inhabited was capable did not mean you immediately knew how to tap into that energy. But you kept at it - you wanted to be able to cast magic at least once, even if it wasn't going to follow you once you were reunited with your own body.

----

In speaking to Ralsei one day, you find out that there is one Darkner in the kingdom who knows Jevil better than most. This interests you, as you have a picture of what Jevil was like up to and *after* his imprisonment, but not before. You had only vague ideas about his personality, his character before that point.

And so, that afternoon, you venture out of Card Castle into Castle Town, nodding toward the citizens you pass by. People are starting to adjust to your presence and your 'restored sanity', and some creatures actually wave back at you - something that delights you.

It's a busy day today - it seems as if you are catching the tail end of a market day, as various darkner monsters are running around catching the last deals of the day, as some stalls are already packing up.

Your destination though is the shop tent which is setup all year round. It's owner, supposedly, knew the jester even before whatever led to his imprisonment, and Ralsei mentioned him being a magician as well, so perhaps he might be able to help you even now?

As you open the tent flaps and step in, though, you notice the lack of lights in the tent. Only one magically dimmed torch lit the area by the door, and even then just enough that one wouldn't stumble about trying to leave. 

The area behind the counter is very dim, almost entirely black, a simple 'Closed' card propped up and nobody around telling you that you've missed your opportunity to converse. 

"Ah, damn," you murmur to yourself. It felt a bit strange though - it wasn't quite dark enough for the permanent shops to be closed. Unless this one just had to close early for whatever reason?

You don't want to just leave it at that though, so you find an ink pen and a bit of card, and you scrawl a message to the absent shopkeeper, explaining who you were and why you were looking for him.

A single cat's eye, well-used to seeing in the dark, watched from the shadows in confusion as you placed the card on the counter and quietly left. Once Seam was certain you were gone, successfully fooled by his plan to avoid reuniting with Jevil the mad jester, he left his perch and retrieved your message, scanning it carefully. His eyes widening in shock as he read your words. 

The broken jester that was once his friend was... now someone completely different inhabiting his body? Seam wanted to put it down to Jevil's mind perhaps coping by having multiple personalities, and yet... some of the details were incredibly specific, or were of things that he had only heard of from the Lightners.

And, well, if anyone *were* powerful enough (and insane enough) to attempt soul-swapping with another being, a *human* even, *at great distance*... it would probably be Jevil.

Perhaps this was something he should investigate...

----

"One moment, please!" You called in reply to the knocking at your door, carefully putting down the quill pen and the magical theory book you were consulting. You stood, glanced around to check that the room and yourself was presentable, then crossed your quarters to the door, opening it. "Oh, hello!" You greeted the nervous plush cat figure on the other side, extending your hand to offer him a handshake. "What can I do for you?"

Seam stared at the figure of his (not) old friend, noticing again how differently he acted. After a moment, he turned his head away briefly to clear his throat, then looked back with fresh eyes, clasping his paw in yours. "Good evening. You erm... left a message for me yesterday."

"...Oh!" You looked over your guest. He was quite a bit taller than you, robes covering most of his body, and patches and repairs littering his form. Even one of his eyes had been replaced with an old clothes button at one point. You could see immediately that Seam had lived a long life so far, and was well looked after. "You must be the former court magician, then. Seam, right? It's a pleasure to meet you, thanks for seeing me." You stepped back from the door to allow him in.

"You will find it is pronounced 'Shawm'," the plush magician gently corrected. *Like 'Shaun'*, you noted to yourself. He stepped inside your room carefully, and you could see that he was nervous, perhaps about being around you/Jevil? You were about to ask whether there was anything you could do to make him feel more at ease, but then you saw him approach you and, quite close to you, gently cup your cheeks in his *wonderfully soft* plush paws, tilting your head up to his. "The Duke spoke with me about your situation, and of course I read the message you had left for me, but it's... something else to see it with my own eyes... You truly are not my old friend in there, are you?"

Your eyes dropped, half-lidded, and you felt a strange sense of guilt as your eyes averted his. "I-I'm sorry."

"Do not be," Seam replied easily, squeezing your cheeks gently. "Trapping you in this form was his decision, not your own. I just... admittedly find it rather difficult to accept." He let go of you, and you looked back toward him, seeing that he seemed to be struggling internally. Finally he took a breath and spoke. "I have... no right to be asking this of you. But I... feel that I must see with my own eyes. And perhaps an examination would... help me understand how to help *you* with some of the concerns you had brought up to me."

Another breath. "Y/N... would you allow me to examine your soul?"

Ah.

Well, you hadn't seen your own soul yet... and if it would help to understand things? Ralsei had seemed to understand you after checking your soul, way back when...

You nodded. "Please, do what you must."

Seam nodded in return, and stood back to allow you to bring out your soul. 

... Which you didn't know how to do. Something that the magician himself seemed to realise after a moment. "Ah - my apologies, it appears I must teach you. I should not be surprised... most monsters or humans nowadays have forgotten about the nature of one's soul."

He guided you through the process of manifesting your soul - apparently most easily accomplished (outside of battle) through physical gestures around the chest. Eventually you felt a strange tugging sensation as something pushed against the inside of your chest before seeming to just... slip through. 

And then... there it was. 

A purple cartoon heart gently pulsed before you, it's soft glow illuminating your open palms beneath it. 

You shook, in awe and wonder and yet also slightly fearful. You were looking at the manifestation of everything that you were - it was an amazing sight, and a little terrifying to think about.

Seam hummed in approval. "Well done. I should not be surprised that you possess a soul of Perseverance."

You blinked, and looked up at him. "You can... tell that?"

He nodded, smiling warmly. "Soul magic is a complicated business, after all, it is magic that forms our very vessels, ha ha... but the trait that determines a human soul's colour is quite simple. You may be guided by one or more core principles, but you could say that the one that colours your soul is your 'primary' trait."

"..." You couldn't help but feel a touch disappointed. "Sooo ... just the fact that I've put up with a lot of bullshit happening in my life, that's now the core aspect of what I am?"

"I would not necessarily think about it in that light," was the magician's response, resting a paw on your shoulder. "You may have suffered many hardships in your journey through life... perhaps there is an ultimate goal you are pursuing, and though you may be beaten down, you are *persisting*, *not giving up*. I believe perseverance is best characterised as knowing that, no matter what life throws in your path, no matter how long it will take, ultimately you will reach your destination, because *you will never truly give up*. You may pause, you may temporarily abandon the task, but you *will* get there in the end. *That* is perseverance."

He guided you to the table to one side of your room, and you both took a seat. After aiding you in guiding your soul back into place in your chest, he continued. "Perhaps think about it in the context of your current situation," he continued. "You have been thrown into the form of someone who had, unfortunately made themselves quite infamous by the time of their imprisonment. Someone else may have simply learned to accept that fate, but you have pushed to try and repair the damage he had done to himself, not taking his reputation as set in stone. And as a result, you are convincing the staff in this castle, as well as the general public, that though you inhabit his body, you are a different person to him. That you are someone capable of being trusted."

You nodded, taking in his words. "I mean... I'm doing what I'm doing not out of any sense of duty to him. More out of a sense of wringing some normality and comfort out of the lot I've been given..."

"And that is just fine," Seam emphasised. "We are allowed to do good things for reasons one might consider selfish, ha ha..." He glanced away. "Why, just yesterday I had hidden from someone who needed my help, because I had thought it was... ahem... an old friend, gone mad. ...I apologise, Y/N, for not having the courage to meet you then."

You raised an eyebrow, but nodded. Could you have done anything differently? It was possible that even if you had called ahead, you would have had the same response (or worse, if Seam had thought the *actual* Jevil was coming for him). "I... guess that gets to the crux of why I wanted to meet. Sure, I'm not letting his history define my present, but, well..." 

Your eyes lowered. "...I want to learn what I can about this monster whose life I've usurped. Those who live here in the castle are hesitant to tell me much, refuse to even mention him, as if I've always been the one in this body, as if mentioning whatever changed him will drive me mad, too. I'm an adult, damn it... Trying to understand Jevil's history won't turn me into him. Er... more than things already have, ha..."

Seam nodded, and sighed. He leaned back in his seat for a moment, eyes glancing at the ceiling. "...It is a long story," he began. "He... was always a bit of a troublemaker, but he was never quite as mad as he was before..."

"Ahem. Allow me to start from the beginning. Once upon a time, before this world grew darker, there were four kings that jointly ruled the land. Together, the King of Clubs, the King of Hearts, the King of Diamonds, and the King of Spades represented their people. Back then... I was their Court Magician, and Jevil their Court Jester. We would entertain the Kings, and occasionally the Kingdom, and over time we would grow to be close friends."

"Back in those brighter days, Jevil was allowed something called 'jester's privilege' - a concept long dead in this age of darkness. The idea was this: Though our kingdom was benevolent, it was known that one could not simply ridicule, question or humiliate the kings and his men directly. Such a thing was just not done! No, instead, as well as entertaining them, the court jester had the unique privilege of being able to be as honest as he wished, even to the point of mockery, without consequence."

"After all," he allowed himself a sly grin, "the jester was already a fool by occupation. Why would anything a fool says truly matter?"

"As such, he became the person the Card Kingdom's citizens went to to voice their concerns. And likewise, the person the Kingdom's monarchy went to for the occasional honest opinion, someone who wouldn't simply validate their decisions like the castle's nobles."

"But..." Seam paused in his retelling, and focused his gaze on you once more. You had been sat, leaning in, legs crossed, hanging on his every word - your eyes wide and your mouth open slightly as you took in the magician's history lesson. Seam took in the sight, unexpectedly reminding him of that old friendship with the jester, when they could talk, and play, and life seemed much simpler. He closed his eyes, and took a breath. "One day, many years ago now, someone came to him. He listened, as was his duty. And this stranger told him something that would ultimately break the man I once knew."

"Jevil was one day told, Y/N, that this world was nothing more than a 'game', a 'show' for some unknown other to exert its control over. That all its people were inextricably bound by unknown rules."

Your mouth clamped shut.

Seam sighed deeply. "I remember that at first, we both had a good laugh about the mad man who told him this. I remember asking him, 'who could have fabricated such a story', only for Jevil to be unable to recall."

"But then... my friend started to hallucinate. It started with him confiding in me that he had been beginning to see others' words written out before him. He believed he could see the HP of others as easily as looking at them. He believed the knowledge he had received was driving him mad. This drove him to try to understand why this was happening to him..."

"The conclusion that Jevil finally arrived at, about... two weeks after the encounter with the strange someone, was that they were *correct*. He began to believe that the Card Kingdom *was* a game of some kind, and that everything that occurred had been predetermined by some higher being."

"He began to believe that by being given this information, he was given the means to 'break free' of this predetermined world he now believed was the truth."

"And he began to believe, Y/N, that if such a thing *were* truth, that anything he did no longer mattered; that if his actions no longer mattered, he could do whatever he pleased without consequences; that if he could do whatever he pleased without consequences, he was breaking free of this 'predetermined control' he saw as reality."

"I tried my best to talk sense back into him, but... he quickly grew out of control, after that," Seam finished sadly. "He became violent, and dangerous, and he unleashed his full magical capability. In the end... as his friend, the Four Kings and I were forced to incapacitate him, and lock him away until the end of his days in a special cell, deep beneath Card Castle. The key was thereafter broken into pieces, such that such a power could not be unleashed. Jevil, as I knew him, was... no more."

Your mind boggled as you processed the words of the former Court Magician. And you weren't entirely sure how to respond either. After all, you already *knew* that Deltarune was a video game, at least where you came from. Plus, you had grown adjusted to the weird 'dialogue box' that was a regular vision at this point.

But, you were already aware of the nature of 'video games' and video game mechanics before you were dropped into this world, which made your current lived experience much easier to swallow. Perhaps, to someone like Jevil who would have had no idea of this sort of thing, living in this pseudo-medieval realm, the revelation of a world that was pre-programmed might be like... a sort of cosmic horror, you realised. You remembered a social media post about an ant being given the intelligence, comprehension of a human, briefly, before having it stripped away, unable to communicate or understand what it just saw. Jevil getting perhaps a glimpse of just how this world was made, built, powered... the revelation that 'before' he was simply a set of sprites, AI code and some written dialogue - a puppet in a play...

Okay, maybe you could see how he had gone 'mad'. "Holy fuck..." you breathed.

Where does that leave you, though? In a sense Jevil was *right*, and you had been seeing the same things he supposedly claimed to see. (Was that because you already knew? Or because it was *his* body you were in?) You couldn't just *say* that, though - one, you'd be locked up even *without* the Kings; two, you didn't want to be responsible for others losing their sanity.

You would keep this knowledge to yourself.

"And that was how it was," Seam continued on eventually, unaware of your internal deliberations, "Until the Four Kings became the Spade King and three missing Kings, and this world was enveloped in Dark. Eventually the Heroes of Light arrived, and in their quest to stop the entropy of the Dark Fountain, they became aware of Jevil's existence. Their mission did not require it, and yet... They sought to tie up the loose end that he represented. They sought the pieces of the key, and when they met him in that cell, the Heroes matched his chaotic magic with great will and determination. His power was sedated..." 

He paused, and his eyes met yours. "Until you came along, it seems, bringing us to the present."

----

A few weeks later, there is a knock at the door to your quarters. You have been summoned to the front of the castle, told that the Lightners have returned with news for you.

You wear Jevil's jester getup today, assuming it is time to get back to your old life, and to put the chaotic soul back in his cell. 

When you arrive, Rouxls is being regaled by Ralsei with tales of the team's adventures while Kris and Susie stand behind him quietly (a little awkwardly, in Susie's case). They notice you immediately as you enter, and they examine you with some concern as you walk up to them. "Hello, hello!" you call, slightly absently - you miss how those present tense up at the repetition, unwittingly repeating Jevil's speech quirk. "Great to see you all again. Travelling well?"

Ralsei nods, but there's an expression of concern and reluctance on his face. "Yes! Uh, the corruption from the Dark World's influence here has been stopped! We've... um, sealed the Fountain, and nothing should come through to torment this world again!"

"Oh! Well, that's excellent news, isn't it! The day will grace this kingdom once more, will it not?"

"Indeed!" Ralsei allowed a smile. 

Kris stepped toward you, and you turned to face him. His expression was unreadable. "Would you like the good news or the bad news first?" He asked.

You thought for a moment, tapping your foot on the floor. "I've always been of the opinion that receiving the good news first will temper the bad news."

Kris nodded. With a brief glance toward the others, the Lightner launched into it. "We found you. Your body, I mean."

"Oh! Amazing!" You gaped. You didn't even know they could *reach* your reality. "And was the little bastard pretending to be me?"

"Not really 'pretending'," Susie chuckled, but her expression was similarly strange. "But yeah. Don't worry, that Jevil is history now."

"Nice! Good work!" You grinned at them. "Thank you for saving me from a world of embarrassment. I can only imagine what he could have done in my body. Now, what's the bad news?"

The foyer was silent. There were grim looks on the groups' faces, as they struggled to figure out how to break the news. Rouxls held a hand to his mouth, eyes wide, shocked. 

"...Guys...?"

They watched as you visibly processed what they had already told you. 

Jevil was in your body. Now Jevil was gone, and your body was safe, uninhabited.

That was how it worked! Right?

Right...? Because the alternative would be...

That your body was...

Your eyes slowly widened, and ever so slowly you turned in place toward Ralsei. By the time you faced him completely, there was a deep fear in your eyes. 

He faced you for a tense, long moment, but eventually his gaze broke away from you and, uncomfortable, he whispered three words that broke you, struck a sharp pain in your soul. 

"I'm sorry, Y/N."

A choked gasp forced its way from your open mouth. 

No.

He hadn't.

Jevil couldn't have gotten you killed. 

He just couldn't have.

You stood silently for a long moment, just staring off into space. 

The life you had lived before, as *yourself*, was over. 

Because some idiot jester had to keep fucking around, now you were stuck in *this* body forever.

After what felt like minutes of silence, you seemed to unfreeze, and the words started to tumble out, slow and quiet at first, but gradually increasing in volume and energy as thought after thought flashed in front of your mind. "...I... Fuck, man. That's not- ...Why would he do that? Why- god, my friends- What about my roommate?! They're- Fucking Jevil- I had a whole life- Why does shit never want to work out for- FUCKING **JEVIL!**"

Somewhere in the midst of your gradually animated rambling, subconsciously, a scythe had fizzled into existence in your hands, and your friends ducked out of the way as you swung it about in your raving. The buzz of Jevil's magic within you surged through your palms into the blade, and as you swung the blade down, punctuating your final exclamation, you felt it catch on *nothing*, then slice.

As the blade cut through the air, a *hole* in the space in front of you opened, a window into another world.

A window into *your* world.

Interrupted by the sight, you blankly stared at the view on the other side.

There you were.

What was left of your own body, that was.

It seemed you had been shot to death, somewhere in the alleyway of a city. Blood had dried around your chest.

Barely thinking, you stumbled to your feet and approached the portal, the others approaching behind. Then, you moved to wedge the scythe into the hole, such that it shouldn't close, then, the moment over, you trembled and slowly fell to your knees.

Sorrow quickly overtook the anger, not replacing it completely, as you stared at the scene through the portal. 

You climbed through, noting that Rouxls did as well, and you stared at your own glassy expression.

This was an awful sight to see. You reached out slowly, with your clawed hands, to carefully close the human body's eyelids.

And then, surrounded by your new monster friends (and Kris), you began to sob uncontrollably, mourning the death of your old life.

----

The next weeks were a blur of malaise and depression and mourning.

You had said once, at the beginning of this whole mess, that you were glad to not be working in your world, enraptured as you were with the casual whimsy of this world, and that still held true. But there were things that you were realising you would potentially never see again that really hit you during this time. 

Computers, phones, technology. Talking to your friends over the internet. Music, especially the dance music and concerts of your time. The particular tingle of soft drinks.

One positive of what had come to pass, for what little positive you could see of it, was that it seemed that whatever bottleneck had kept you from the usage of magic had lifted. 

Though you had moved your magic training and learning to a part of the Crimson Forest a reasonable ways off the beaten track (enough that you could rest easier about anyone unexpectedly becoming a victim of another emotionally-induced magical surge), you quickly mastered basic magical spells and began to tap into the magics that were closely tied to your soul... and those that powered the body you possessed. 

Though Ralsei was unavailable to guide you, as he wished he were able - currently helping Kris and Susie to fulfill the prophecy and prevent what he called 'The Roaring' - Seam found time on occasion to nudge you toward discovering your latent soul magic. He was also able to show you how to summon 'bullets' - pure magic energy condensed into a shape befitting the caster, full of intent.

The comment that most monsters learned this very basic magic and the power of intent at a young age did hang in your mind more than it perhaps should have, considering you were not a native monster, but alas, that was just how depression was. Always looking for a way to beat you down.

It quickly became apparent when you moved on from basic spells to more personalised magic, following the whims of the energy inside you that 'your' magic was mostly Jevil's chaotic magic. But Seam commented at least once during this phase of exploration that it seemed slightly more refined, focused. There were hints, perhaps, of ways to filter that raw power through your Perseverance soul to accomplish... something. Neither of you were quite sure what that would look like yet, and it would likely take lots more training to accomplish anything quite as powerful as your speculations.

The bullets that Jevil's magic summoned were, confusingly, seemingly themed after card suits - hearts, diamonds, clubs and spades. At first you didn't understand why. It took you one day much later for the full realisation to hit: you were in the Card Kingdom. You were somewhat friends with Rouxls Kaard ('Rules Card', as you kept hearing his name pronounced). The deposed king, in a prison cell in the dungeons, was the King of Spades. 

You, or rather Jevil - you were a Jester. Or rather - to complete the analogy that was only now hitting you with full clarity - the *Joker* of the Card Kingdom.

Wait, did that mean ...? What *did* that mean? That this world's rules and manner were based on a card deck? You hadn't really thought much about the difference between the Light and Dark worlds. You'd have to ask Ralsei or one of the Lightners about it next time you had the chance...

----

The last day of your second life began with a request from Kris to meet you in a clearing in the Crimson Forest.

At midnight.

If you weren't certain, three months into your life as Jevil, that the wilderness was safe *enough* for liaisons like this, you would have thought that Kris had some ulterior motive. Sure, he was just slightly creepy in that odd teenager way, and he had those red eyes (but only sometimes, which still eluded you), but he was - y'know - the hero of this story you were living in. Plus, he and his friends from the Light World had been ever-so-helpful in figuring yourself out.

And that was why you traversed quietly through the forest paths, your cowl keeping you warm, the jester outfit underneath. A ball of light held in your left hand lit the path ahead.

It was kind of peaceful, if you had to be honest with yourself.

As you entered the clearing where you were to meet, you pulsed more magic into the orb briefly, its glow brightening and illuminating the area as you glanced around.

You were the first to arrive, it seemed.

You leaned against a nearby tree and waited.

It was a few minutes before, though nobody appeared in your field of vision, a familiar voice said gently, *right into your ear*, "There's something I've been meaning to ask."

You flinched away, turning your head to see Kris standing right next to where you had been, shit-eating grin on his face. You growled in frustration. "Jesus, Kris, can you *ever* be a normal human being?"

"Well, so, that's the thing." You noted his eyes were red again tonight. "So you're a real person, right?"

You stared at him. "...rrrriiiight...?"

(You noted to yourself that Kris was already speaking more than he usually does.)

"Right. So." He approached you slowly, his intense gaze boring into you. "How do I become part of this world?"

You blinked. Then again. "...You're... right here."

"No, *Kris* is here," Kris said. "*I'm* not."

Your eyes darted back and forth, taking in Kris's details. Your utter confusion must have shown on your face, as Kris continued, "I mean, I know Kris is the Angel's Vessel n' all but I mean-- have you even *played* Deltarune?"

*Deltarune.*

This wasn't *Kris* talking to you. This was the *Angel*, the *Player* behind Kris, currently controlling him from somewhere in your world.

And they were asking you... how to get *into* the game's world?!

"I uh." You closed your eyes and pressed your gloved hands into your face. "I didn't really ask to be here in the first place. You know that."

"Yeah, yeah." Now 'Kris' was pushing into your personal space. You gave him a gentle push away. "I bet that's just the *lore* reason. I mean look at you! You can do magic and you're friends with the gang for being *you*! *I* wanna be friends with them too! I mean we know Jevil would never act like that!"

"The fuck?" You were offended by how this person seemed to assume that you just wrote yourself into the story to be part of Deltarune's world. You jabbed a clawed finger into Kris's armour. "The fuck is your problem? I didn't ask for Jevil to do what he did. I didn't ask to *lose my body* to be here! Have I dreamed of being in a video game world, sure! I've never wanted to *die* to make that happen!"

"I don't know that."

"You were *there*! You found my body in the first place!"

"No, *that* was Kris." They tutted as they shook their head at you, and you huffed. "Seriously, it's like you don't even know."

"Of *course* I don't! Know what?!" You were letting him get a rise out of you, despite yourself. "I never played through Deltarune, dude! I never played fuckin' *Undertale*! Never got around to it!"

The death glare that the Player gave you in response to that was intense. You could vividly imagine the complaint going unspoken in their head. *How could you, having no prior connection to this universe and its people, blah blah blah **WHILE I, WHO HAS DONE SO MUCH FOR...*** Yawwwwwn. You were quickly getting an idea of the kind of person that the Player was.

Through Kris they spoke quietly, "Well, I think it's unfair, you know? And this has been some nice 'additional content' or whatever, but I think if I'm not allowed to be part of this world--"

Suddenly, 'Kris' withdrew his sword from its scabbard, and you were too late to react - you found yourself shivering in fear, the point of the sword poised just beneath your chin. 

'Kris' smirked, finishing the statement. "... I think you don't get to be either."

Before he could act (and not ACT), you reached for the magic surging through you, warping a few steps away as the Player thrust the sword upward. *That would have gone through your head*, you realised in shock.

*They actually wanted to kill you.*

Anger and adrenaline surged through you. "Let Kris go," you snarled, conjuring up a few spade bullets, letting them just hover in place in front of you. "They don't deserve to be part of this." For additional protection, you reached out your hand and summoned Jevil's blade to your side.

At least, that was your intent.

But it did not appear.

"Oh," the Vessel murmured calmly, a smug smile on their face. "Perhaps looking for this?"

Letting the sword hang loosely from their hand, they reached behind themselves with the other, and pulled out -- *they had your blade*. When did that happen?

The scythe went away again, and the Vessel began to charge at you, holding Kris's sword in both hands. You launched your idle bullets at him before warping again, to the opposite side of the clearing. You could already tell you needed to stop using his warping magic - maybe it was because you had *just* learned to use that aspect of your magic, but it was using up more of your reserves than you expected. You flung more bullets in his direction in an attempt to slow him down...

And then turned tail and fled through the dark forest, 'Kris' in hot pursuit.

You had to reach Castle Town, at least. Would the Player still try to kill you if you had an audience? Could you wake anyone up? For perhaps the first time you bemoaned Jevil's form's lack of stamina--

**[ENOUGH,]** boomed a new voice from what felt like all directions.

The world around you and 'Kris' went black, and both of you were forced to a stop. The echo of the booming voice that had suddenly spoke to you reverberated around you both.

**[JESTER. YOUR STORY ENDED LONG AGO.]**

You eyed 'Kris', gesturing rudely at him. Speaking to whereever this voice was coming from, you began, "I am *not* Jevil--"

**[I DO NOT PARTICULARLY CARE.]**

"...Rude."

**[ANGEL.]**

The Vessel turned, responding to the voice's call, and you followed to see that a dark, imposing knight figure had appeared in this void with you, staring impassively at you with it's weapon drawn, but not ready to strike. And behind them...

Very faint shapes of something massive, something ominous, loomed over the three of you. It felt like it should have been invisible, but its aura in this moment or... *something*... was so imposing at that moment. You got the impression that *this* was the booming voice speaking to you.

Was *this* the entity pulling the strings here? The one orchestrating this spread of darkness, bleeding the realities of Deltarune together?

The entity continued to speak to the Player.

**[THIS IS AN UNNECESSARY DISTRACTION, ANGEL.]**

**[REMEMBER, YOUR CONNECTION TO THIS WORLD IS TEMPORARY.]**

**[PROLONGING IT BY INDULGING IN THESE FANTASIES WILL NOT BE TOLERATED.]**

**[THIS DETOUR IS HEREBY OVER.]**

**[YOU HAVE WORK TO DO.]**

**[WORK THAT MANY WOULD REPLACE YOU TO DO.]**

**[I WILL ALLOW YOU TO CONTINUE ON ONE CONDITION.]**

In a flash, Jevil's scythe once again appeared in the Vessel's hand.

***[ERADICATE  HIM.]***

...

Slowly, silently, Kris, the Vessel, turned toward you.

"Kris," you began.

He took one step toward you.

"You're allowed to walk away, dude."

And another.

You tried to take a step back - but you couldn't move. 

Something was controlling you, keeping you in place. 

You felt the full weight of the puppetmaster's hold on you.

You could only watch in growing terror as the Player approached, expression blank.

**[YOU MISUNDERSTAND, JESTER.]**

They raised the blade up, readying it for a swing.

**[THIS IS NOT THE ANGEL'S CHOICE TO MAKE.]**

***[IT IS MINE.]***

The blade came down, slicing through your chest.

There was an instant of hot pain, agony like you had never felt--

And then-

Nothing.

...

* The Devilsknife has gone quiet.

...

...

----

"......"

"...did... ...fr...?"

Your world was a near impenetrable fog, your self... aware of almost nothing. You could not tell the passage of time, how long you had been here. 

Your prison was dark and void, formless... much like yourself. Occasionally you felt a sense of being held, a warmth, a comfort - even if you were in no shape to process those feelings.

After what might have felt like an eternity existing without consciousness, soon you began to feel, to take shape once more. You were still trapped within your mind, but gradually your mind began to awaken and dream once more.

At first your dreams were a blur, more colors and concepts, vague feelings than something substantial. But as the days progressed your dreams became more 'real', more solid. Your brain, your mind was able to start forming objects and structures in your thoughts once more.

In one such dream, you were exploring a gigantified version of your home, roaming your cluttered computer desk like some kind of borrower. Stepping around Stream Decks and controllers and cables, you were exploring as a tiny version of yourself, and it was kind of exhilarating--

"How fun, fun!"

Your head snapped up, as a shadow loomed over you.

Jevil, sat in your chair, many times larger than you, smiled down at you. "Is this the kind of adventures humans like you dream of? I daresay it's rather cute~."

You blinked. "I'm...?" You shook your head. "Of- of course I must be dreaming. I'm small and--" You paused, eyes narrowing. "...Hang on... Something... happened. Didn't it?"

"Indeed, indeed!" He beamed. "And now we are both truly free, free of the puppetmaster who sought to play his games~!" He looked especially pleased about this fact.

"...Okay, but how?" You leaned against the handle of a Dualsense controller. "Because I think I remember you died in *my* body... unless I finally *am* succumbing to the madness everyone thought you had."

"Ueeheehee! You're funny, little lightner." A large hand descended toward you, and despite your attempt at brushing him away, he picked you up with ease, holding you in his palm. "*That* was a diversion! You see, young Kris and I had so much fun with our numbers game that I decided to join him! By placing my soul in the weapon that I bestowed upon him, I could be as free as I desired, and the King and the Puppetmaster would be none-the-wiser, none-the-wiser!" He grinned, fanged teeth visible. "I simply needed someone to take my place~!"

You crossed your arms, frowning. "...Well, you got me, I'm a sucker. So why are you bringing me with you now...?"

A gentle claw brushed over your head, but Jevil didn't answer immediately. His smile dimmed slightly as he decided how best to answer your query. "...The puppetmaster... He was the one to reveal the nature of our world to me, the nature of the game we were all pawns in. And while, yes yes, perhaps my sanity has been damaged by the revelation, in my cell I truly was free, free from the puppet master's strings!"

He held you more gently, cradling you in his palm while continuing his idle petting. "But playing with Kris, struggling with their own control... And then seeing you, attempting to build a new life for me - I could see you were kind, and curious, and strong in your perseverance... and I knew *he* would take notice eventually."

He sighed, and smiled wistfully. "I had hoped to save us both in a much less painful manner... but once he forced Kris's possessor to take action, I had to work quickly to get us both out of there... And now... we truly are both free from those strings that bound us!" He lit up once more, and Jevil pressed you against his chest with both hands.

He was soft, warm; the velvet of his outfit brushing lightly against your exposed skin. The lack of a heartbeat was strange and not something you had really noticed when you had been in his body, but this was also a dream, so you weren't sure if that was real or not. You relaxed into him, wondering whether monster souls had a heartbeat. Why would they?

You shook your head to loosen the thought from your mind. It wasn't important right now. "That.. makes a bit of sense, but doesn't quite answer my question. You coulda left me for-- Oh my god, I died," you said, cutting yourself off as the memory finally resurfaced of Kris, possessed, standing before you with a scythe you yourself wielded briefly.

And of the massive figure of the black Void that commanded the Player, and the Knight that represented them... *that* must have been the 'puppetmaster'. The Angel, the Player was his agent, and yet not quite under his control.

"*You*, your soul, is quite safe with me!" Jevil chirped up.

You blinked. "Y- ...You absorbed my soul?"

The jester shook his head in the negative. "I would do no such thing! How could you know of monsters and souls, lightner?" He lifted you away from him again and stared down at you, cheekily poking at you with a gentle claw. "Your world was quite boring, bereft of magic from what I had seen!"

You squirmed under his touch. Well... As if he didn't know. May as well say it. "I... have a bit of an idea of how some things work from, ah, games involving your world?"

Jevil stopped, squinting down at you suspiciously.

Then, with a poof and a popping noise, you found yourself at your full size, and both of you crashed to the floor. After a moment to get your bearings, you found that you were roughly the same size as the jester, his face level with yours.

"I want to be clear," you stressed as you both sat on the ground facing each other in this dream version of your living room. "I'm not the 'puppetmaster' or affiliated with him. But my understanding is that the thing that controls Kris is someone who *literally* sees the world as a game, a program. Now, whether this puppermaster-- *puppetmaster*, god, English is hard sometimes- whether he's pulling their strings as well, I don't know. But... well, I saw what you saw. Y'know, when I was you." You leaned in, resting a hand on his shoulder. "People speaking to me, whose words I saw on the edge of my vision. The same words telling me I restored HP when I ate. The everpresent feeling of being watched from all angles, whenever Kris was around with those red eyes..."

"I *understand* how you must have felt. The bastard was *right*, and nobody else saw it." You sighed, muttered "ah, fuck it", and embraced him. "And from the sounds of things, now we are rid of all that. So if we are sticking together, where does that leave us?"

Jevil's cheeks flushed, his smile dropping in surprise - not at all expecting this soul he had rescued to be suddenly hugging him - realising that he had missed being touched, from all his time being 'free' alone in the cell he had called his own. The validation, the relief that this human had seen and understood what he had gone through, when no one else had any idea what he was talking about... except perhaps Kris, from what this soul had said.

A small smile returned to his lips. "I have rescued us to a new world! Some time has passed since you have been among the living, and I enlisted the help of the dark Prince in secret to create a vessel for your soul! Being a monster vessel, it requires a source of magic, and well, well, I have plenty to spare! And now we can explore this new realm we have found once you fully reawaken! How does that sound?"

The implication took a moment to sink in. "Wait, you and Ralsei made me a body again? You... risked being caught to help me? Why...?"

"Why not!" He beamed and got to his feet, bouncing happily about the room. "I can do anything! That foolish puppetmaster can't find me, not without poor Kris! And besides..."

He turned to you once more, good smile turning impish.

"What's wrong with a little chaos, chaos?" He giggled, and pranced over to you, petting you on the head. "For now, my new friend, you should rest. Our new world won't go anywhere while you finish recovering. And if you should need accompaniment while you dream, Jevil is not far away~!"

He beamed, bouncing on his feet into the next room and out of sight.

When you got up and looked, he was nowhere to be found.
