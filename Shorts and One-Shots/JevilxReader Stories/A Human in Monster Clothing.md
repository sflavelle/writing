You're not quite sure when you realise you're conscious.

What came to you first?
Was it the hum of fluorescent lights somewhere above?
The sensation of sluggishness that permeated your being, born of your prior coma state?
The texture of the sheet draped over your fur?

...huh? *Fur*?

You groan and slowly shift in your bed, slowly blinking your eyes open.

The room is dark, but not pitch black. A light - the fluorescent tube light you hear is somewhere to your right, seemingly through a doorway - allowing the ability to see, but not blind you. Slowly, you turn your head to face the light with a yawn, moving your arm in preparation to shade your eyes. Yep, that's fur.

(You vaguely remember being told that you were given a new body, a vessel for your soul, so you don't freak too much - but you feel... strange.)

(Part of you thinks you probably *should* examine your vessel. But... that can wait until you've examined whereever you are a bit more.)

Getting a better look at the room, it seems reminiscent of a hospital ward. But... you're the only one here, and - you check behind you - there are no windows.

You wonder where Jevil left you. And for that matter, just where the jester had gone off to himself.

You slowly lift the sheets covering you to the side. Yep, that's more fur. White and light shades of brown. You lift yourself up and without thinking further, you shift your body to the side and lift off the bed and onto your feet with a loud 'clack' as your feet(?) land on the tiled floor.

You flinch, your legs snapping back up off the ground. The harsh noise takes you completely by surprise. you look at yourself...

Oh. Those are... those are the animal kinda legs, not the 'furry' human-like ones your brain was expecting. What was the term? Digitigrade? Yeah? No, the other one. Ani... pluh... Plantigrade. Plantigrade! Yeah, that sounded right.

Welp guess you suddenly had to learn to walk with legs that didn't bend the way you're used to. Fuck.

And... you had hooves. So that was what you heard - hard... bone? Keratin? You weren't awake/alive enough for this shit - that made up your feet hitting the floor.

So... it seemed you had woken up as some kind of anthropomorphic deer monster.

Well, this was going to be something.

----

It took you longer than you felt comfortable admitting to get across the room, from the bed to the doorway, but at least your legs seemed strong... enough.

They held you - if you held yourself right. And you weren't quite used to how this new body wanted to be held, just yet.

You're glad nobody's seen you yet.

Though the dim blinking LED of a security camera, unnoticed by you in your struggle, begs to differ.

You decide to keep trying, turning around and slowly, with more confidence than previously, stepping back over to the bed.

Immediately you sat on the thin mattress once you reached it, giving your aching lower half a break. You were panting, if only because for part of the process of getting to and from the door you had been holding your breath. (That was a you thing, annoyingly.) You were starting to understand how your new legs worked... Starting to.

As you started to settle again, you became aware of a humming gradually increasing in volume. After some racking your brain about it, you placed the sound of doors sliding open, and realised an elevator had arrived.

Then there was the sound of footsteps - someone padding down the corridor outside the door toward you, gentle thumps with a clicking noise to it. Ah, people *do* exist here. Perhaps Jevil, through whatever soul connection you two had, had noticed you had awoken.

Their shadow appeared in the doorway shortly before the person it belonged to.

It was not Jevil.

This monster, however, you *did* know - if only through osmosis.

She gave a little squeak as she noticed you already looking at her, adjusting the glasses over her yellow snout so her vision was clear. She looked up into your eyes... and flinched back. "Ah! Oh, I-I'm so sorry! Um, your eyes are... striking."

"Are they...?" You furrowed a brow. "I... haven't seen them yet."

"Ah..." After a deep breath, she walked over to you, her claws clicking against the tiled floor. She looked quite tired, and you couldn't help but wonder whether it was dark here because it was late at night, or you (and evidently everyone else here) were underground... You wondered separately, whether she was overworked at the same time...

You prepared to listen carefully to what Alphys, the Underground's Royal Scientist, had to tell you.

"W-well in any case, g-good evening," the lizard greeted with a nervous smile. "It's good t-to see you finally awake. Welcome to the Lab, you can c-call me Dr. Alphys." She consulted the clipboard she had been holding to her side. "Um, a monster by the name of Jevil has deposited you in my care a few days ago after you both arrived from, he said another world...? Uh, b-but th-that's not important right now! I-it uhm, just means you'll need an introduction to the Underground! A-anyway, from my understanding you've been through a lot?"

...Okay, so Jevil had just so happened to discover the Undertale universe (or *an* Undertale universe? Who knew what bullshit you were dealing with now), and had dropped you off here of all places where he went to do... something? You nodded. "Yeah... that's right. Considering the last memory i remember after such a long, erm sleep was..." You wracked your brain. "Uh... getting stabbed."

Alphys just stared at you blankly. "I... Well, you uh... Seem? To be alive? Ahem. Well. It is... quite late in the evening, so I hope you'll understand that I will keep this short. I uh, figure introductions now would be good and we'll run some checkups on you at a more... reasonable hour." She chuckles. 

You blinked, then nodded, smiling warmly. "Oh, no stress at all! I completely understand that. Perhaps some quick introductions then and I can let you, ahh, return to sleep or something?"

"Heh, u-um, actually I haven't been to bed yet." The lizard seemed embarrassed. If you had to guess the rough time, it must have been super late at night. "I was just about to um... make a snack and wind down with a few episodes of t-the show I'm watching at the moment..." She paused, and her expression shifted briefly. Was she nervous? "If you, um... don't feel tired at the moment, y-you could... join me in the living space upstairs if you feel hungry...?"

You felt at your stomach. "I don't... feel terribly hungry yet, but I guess I'll need the meal. Oh, uh - I'm Y/N. Sorry, doing this all out of order," you chuckled. To be fair to yourself, you weren't you for a while there.

Alphys nervously giggled with you. "T-thats fine! You *have* been through a lot, it sounds like..."

----

You spent the next hour or so in an upstairs lab room that was repurposed as a living room space, eating from a cup of noodles while watching what was apparently season 2 of an anime the doctor was watching. You both sat on the small couch (though respectfully you gave her some room) as 'Mew Mew' vowed to 'light up the darkness' through magical girl transformations or something like that. 

You fell asleep again sooner than you expected, and when you woke sometime that 'morning' you had had a blanket draped carefully over you, and a hand mirror placed nearby. You were pleasantly surprised - you had no idea how long you were in Alphys' care before you woke, but you had perhaps expected for her to be less personal. Whatever the reason, though,  you were content - you weren't in immediate danger, and while Jevil had still not shown his face since you awoke, around Alphys you felt safe enough. 

One glance at your face in the mirror showed you why you had given the good doctor a shock - though the body was your own this time (by your knowledge, anyway - in fact it looked like a fursona you had had), you had still retained Jevil's distinctive black eyes and gold irises, now even more shocking on this normal body. 

Speaking of the scientist, she was fascinated with the world you had come from - "That explains how you're so comfortable with all this," she had said. She told you that she wanted especially to examine your 'shell' and your soul... "T-to see how it has adapted, o-of course!"

And you weren't looking forward to having your soul exposed - because it would expose your humanity underneath all the fur and borrowed magic. You didn't know much about souls, even after your time in the Card Kingdom, but you *did* know that souls from humans looked noticeably different from monster souls.

You tried to dance around the subject with details of your previous adventure - she was shocked to learn that the monster you had arrived in the Underground with had previously soul-swapped with you to escape 'un-imprisonment' - but Alphys of course soon caught on. 

"I just don't see what my soul is going to tell you," you'd said awkwardly in the main room, finishing your breakfast noodles.

"Well," she began, "It'll tell us a fair bit about your stats, certain traits you might possess, your soul color... it might even tell us about potential differences in monsters and humans from your world compared to ours!"

"What do humans have to do with this?" You cocked your head to the side.

"Uh, w-well, y'know..." Alphys vaguely gestured at you, looking away in embarrassment.

"...No, I don't," you said carefully, but your sudden guarded, nervous expression betrayed your concern. "I-I mean, clearly I'm not..."

Alphys sighed, and took a deep breath. "...Y/N, i-it's *okay*," she said carefully. "I... I *know* you have a human soul." 
 
 You paused, full fork touching your lips, your irises pinpricks.

"He... ...Jevil wasn...wasn't careful about keeping your soul hidden before you were given this vessel. I've *seen* the shape of your soul."

...Maybe you should've known that Jevil was the kind of monster to play fast-and-loose with other people's things.

You stared at her for a few long moments, but then you slurped up the noodles, then slumped back in your chair, staring up at the ceiling. You exhaled slowly, then took a deep breath to collect your thoughts. "...Fuck," you finally settled on.

Alphys snorted, despite the tense moment. After calming herself down and taking a few breaths, having managed to breach the subject, she finally managed to get the words out. "I-it was an accident. Um, J-Jevil - When... when you were just a soul, we kept him to a room like you were in, y'know to assess his threat level-- h-he must have carried you around with him, but he um, I don't think he knew I kept surveillance in the lab. He um... when he was alone in that room, I guess he just, had your soul out sometimes? T-to talk to you or something? M-Mettaton was the first to notice it, when um, when he would come by for maintenance."

"And then there was one day, I went to visit him and there was just? A hole? In the wall? Not that he broke the wall, no-- it was like... a window to somewhere else entirely... And he came out of it carrying your body as it is now. And he asked me to look after you like we d-did for him. I um, I think he's a couple towns away at the moment? In uhh... Snowdin I think? I think he may be looking for somewhere for you both to stay."

You were silent for a minute, processing what she told you as you finished eating. She had known for... some amount of time, that you were definitely human, and in fact that for a time you had been just a soul. In a world where - you recall vaguely - these monsters needed human souls to break free from the Underground, you were surprised that you were still here. Your eyebrows raised as you thought. Alphys - and apparently Mettaton - could have easily decided to just take your soul while you were unconscious and put it towards the barrier. But here you were. Why? Was it because of a threat of Jevil's power? Did Alphys feel some obligation that succeeded her own duty to the crown?

Come to think of it, there was a gap of time between your death at the hands of the Angel's Vessel and when you began to dream again. Could it be that gaining a body was what triggered your return to awareness, your return to the waking world?

Something to ask Jevil when you next saw him.

You finished off your noodle cup, and set it aside. "...Right," you finally said, fixing your gaze on her. "But I take it my presence isn't exactly... ideal." You spoke vaguely, since you were at least aware that you weren't *supposed* to be aware of certain things here yet.

Alphys hissed through her teeth, glancing away again. She made a hand gesture 'so-so'. "Well yes... and no." She sighed, and looked back. "Because of... certain events that have happened over the course of monster existence, we are trapped here under the earth because of humans. We are getting close to freeing ourselves, but so far, the best method that we have of doing so is... well, um, c-collecting the souls of fallen h-humans." Her eyes snapped away again. "W-we have... uh... five so far. We need... seven."

"...I see." You nodded quietly, leaning back in your seat to stare up at the roof of the lab. "...Am I going to be one of them?"

Alphys was silent at first.

Your expression sank.

"...T-that's what I want to find out," she finally said, in a quiet voice. "By... by law, all human souls are to be taken to A-Asgore, our king. Their power is... that is, the power of their souls... is required to break the Barrier. As... humans were the ones that put us down here. The ones that um... were responsible for the d-deaths of his children."

"Oh, shit." You bit your lip. "I... can understand why he wouldn't be happy with them then."

She nodded. "But... you're not *from* the surface, are you? Not our surface. Assuming that you from the same place Jevil came from ...If... you'd let me learn about you, and do some tests... I could make a case for an exception for you. Not being a surface human. You... seem nice enough. O-or at least, you haven't tried to kill me." She awkwardly chuckled, trying to lighten the mood.

You responded to the latter remark with a raised eyebrow. "Well... let me know what I can do to help you, I suppose. Uh - short of giving my life, of course." You had to at least return Alphys' awkward light-making joke.

She nodded, and smiled lightly.

----

And so, you allowed yourself to be examined for the rest of the day. Alphys was thorough with her work - examining your soul's condition, noting its prominent Perseverance trait, followed by gentle CHECKs and probes to determine your statistics.

Then she moved on to taking a look at the matter that comprised your soul vessel. She found herself confused but fascinated by your body being made not of pure magic like other monsters, but *darkness*-infused magic - tinged with something close to, but not quite Void. You had to remind yourself that it was because it was Ralsei the Prince of Darkness that had created this Darkner vessel to hold your soul.

It was veins *within* the dark vessel that carried the magic through the body and protected the soul. Your magical link with Jevil was also found in this examination - a pool of magical energy that ebbed and flowed gently *around* your soul as your body used it, replenished from some unseen source.

Between discussions around the tests that she was doing, she also talked to you about *you* - talking about behaviors, interests (she got excited when you told her you were into computers). She cocked an eyebrow as you mentioned that you had an intellectual disorder, then interrupted you while you were mentioning your difficulty understanding body language and your brain being wired up slightly differently to tell you that she had seen that in some monsters regularly. (Knowledge gained, monsters knew about autism.)

While you and Alphys were in the midst of debating and debunking human behaviors from her 'history tapes' (mostly more anime) you were interrupted by the doors into the lab slamming open dramatically, followed by a new voice.

"ALPHYS, DARLING~! I'M HERE FOR MY SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE!"

"Oh, whoops," Alphys muttered, then looked up at you, a blush forming on her cheeks. "Sorry Y/N, I'll have to wrap this up for now." She finished writing something on her clipboard, then called out as she stood, "Over here, Mettaton! S-sorry, I got distracted!"

"What with, my dear?" The effeminate voice asked, getting closer, until they rounded the corner and stopped, seemingly seeing you.

...Well, you weren't sure what kind of monster you expected Mettaton to be, but this wasn't it.

"Oh!" The rectangular robot scooted forward on his wheel to get up close to you. "You're awake! How delighted I am to meet you, my dear... deer." He chuckled lightly, extending his telescopic arms to shake yours. "I trust you've not been keeping dear Alphys here too busy?"

"Ahah... not more than she would normally be, I assume." You nodded toward her.

"Mettaton," Alphys spoke up suddenly, "would y-you keep Y/N here entertained while I prep the usual room?"

"Of *course*, darling!" The robot bowed, exaggerating his motion slightly (at least, that's how it felt to you). "I promise you, we won't be going anywhere."

"T-thanks." She smiled nervously. "I won't be too long. Please, no arguing. O-or chainsaws."

She ducked out of the room, missing how you slowly turned your head toward the robot, raising an eyebrow. "Uh... chainsaws?"

His screen lit up in a simple smiley face. Somehow it gave you the creeps. "Be kind to her, darling, and you won't find out."

As the two of you began to chat, Alphys ducked into a nearby room, slid the door shut, then took out her phone and dialled a number. 

It rang four times before the monster on the other end responded. "Howdy, Doctor! Is everything alright?"

"Y-yes sir, I'm perfectly fine. I rang to inform... uh... t-the *subject* has awoken, Asgore."

There was a pause, followed by a heavy sigh on the other end... The sigh of a person that had hoped that he might not see this day, inevitable though it was. "I see. Please, tell me everything you can."

----

Although at first Mettaton the robot monster was skeptical of your intentions underground - though he had to admit, being unconscious for several weeks and in fact being *revived* by a monster somehow had helped your case...

As he interviewed you, sitting across the couch from each other in the main room...

The way you answered his questions the best as you were able, offering information about yourself and what you knew about why you were in the Underground (Jevil probably just ended up here and liked it?) and how you and Jevil met up (he soulswapped with you to escape imprisonment, then only jumped in to save your soul when an extradimensional entity threatened your soul/his body (yes you were upset about being manipulated))...

He felt you were at least not lying or hostile.

That didn't mean that he wasn't feeling *urges*, with your soul (and a path to stardom on the surface) right there in front of him...

But he had already been denied by Doctor Alphys, and well, with her plan explained to him, he was at least sated. It would be the same result if King Asgore used your soul for the barrier, of course.

Now if only he had not been sworn to secrecy... this would have the underground buzzing! Alas...

Alphys re-entered the room after a few minutes of chatter, carrying a black piece of equipment under her arm. "Alright Mettaton, sorry to keep you waiting," she said sheepishly. "Um, Y/N, while you're waiting for us, I was wondering if you might take a look at something for me?"

She walked over to the lounge nook where you were sat and placed the device on the table. Now that you could see it more clearly, you could see that it was an old laptop from the surface. As you reached to open it, she explained, "I uh, found this in the dump last time I was down there, it looks like a type of computer but even after drying it it appears... not to work. I've got some tools on the bench over there," she cocked her head toward her workbench, "so if there's anything you can figure out about how this is put together, or if you can even repair it... anything helps." She smiled.

"Hmm, sure!" You grinned back. "I'm not *as* familiar with laptops compared to desktop machines, but it's more or less the same thing just packaged differently. I'll see what I can find."

"Aha~" The robot suddenly said to himself, an '!' appearing on his screen. "I recognise that spark in your eye! I daresay, Alphys darling, you may have found a likeminded soul. I hope, for your sake that the King is lenient in his judgment." He paused. "Wait, was I not supposed to--?"

"I know the deal, Alphys told me," you waved him off. "I'll cross that bridge when we get to it. Now I believe you have some servicing to get done... 'darling'." You couldn't help the childish act of sticking your tongue out at him, as you pulled the dead laptop toward you, examining it more closely.

----

You were left alone for the better part of an hour to look at the device and take notes. There were rust stains on the plastic casing and a few minor signs of water damage, hinting at corrosion on the internal components. You didn't know anything about what 'the dump' was like, but from clues on and inside the laptop it seemed to be a wet or at least humid environment.

Raiding from Alphys' stash of mismatched screwdrivers at her workbench, you found one that fit the laptop's small Philips screws and managed to get the underside off. You were in the process of spreading out the socketed and unscrewable components on the table...

...when the door into the lab opened, and a gust of hot air from outside rushed past you. Even that brief breath of Hotland air was stifling. "Hiya," you called, glancing briefly at the guest who had just entered before returning to your work. "Alphys is busy at the minute, I think she'll be out shortly--"

The glowing blue spear that then blocked your view of the laptop's internals got you to shut up. The side pressed at your face, prodding you to look back up at its owner.

A scowling redheaded fish woman in a black tank top and denim jeans.

You sighed, and rolled your eyes, nodding your head back toward the rear of the lab. "She's in one of the exam rooms with Mettaton."

You made to return to your work, and missed how she rised an eyebrow at you, dispelling her spear. "...good on Alphys for finally hiring an assistant. Stars knows she needs one with everything she does for us. Hey, make sure she doesn't push herself too hard, alright?"

"Yes ma'am," you replied simply, resuming your disassembly.

You heard her walk past, and a door slide open and shut.

You quietly tinkered away for a few minutes, trying to ignore the occasional muffled shouting from the exam room. Amazingly, despite the water damage to the frame, and minor surface rusting of the laptop's main board, none of the traces on the board seemed corroded. Perhaps this computer could be restored after all!

You turned from the workbench to start checking through Alphys' cabinets, hoping you might find some isopropyl alcohol to start cleaning the individual components...

Before the bang of the exam door slamming open had you jump and slam your head on the ceiling of the cabinet, causing you to swear. As you straightened, rubbing your head, you turned around to see what (likely who) made the noise.

And paused when you saw the visitor, approaching you with purpose, their gaze laser-focused.

She raised a hand, and another magic spear phased into existence within it.

Her grin took on a shark-like quality. And the few words she spoke made you tremble.

"*I know what you are.*"

Your eyes went wide. You vaguely noticed Mettaton and Alphys rush out into the main room to try and call her to stop. But she continued to approach.

And you stayed pressed against the bench, feet feeling glued to the ground as she reached you, fist grabbing into your shirt harshly and lifting you up, poised to attack.

Trying to control your hyperventilating, you finally spoke. "...H-hi? Can I help you...?"

Her grin thinned down to a smirk. "Yes. You can. I am Captain Undyne of the Underground Royal Guard..."

"...and *you* are human soul number six. I'll be taking that off your hands now."

You felt the intent before she thrust the spear forward.

And like instinct, a movement born of memory, you did the first thing you could think of.

You pulled at the mana in your synthetic veins and *willed* yourself out of the way.

The world blinked out and-

You hit the ground on the opposite end of the main room, clutching your chest. For a moment you thought you saw purple hands and sharp claws, but another blink and you were looking at your own light brown/white hands.

...Right, you had done this before. Before, in another life, as another person.

...A person whose magic still surged through you.

"How the--?!" Undyne whirled around, spotting you behind the other two monsters who also turned to stare at you, shocked. Her spear was buried in the wood of the cabinet, causing it to splinter. "Get BACK here and DIE!"

---

"NO!" You screamed out, as the last spear buried itself in your SOUL and dissipated.

The next moments seemed to happen in slow motion.

There was a sharp *crack* that rang out like a gunshot in the enclosed space as your eyes went wide.

A bright glow diverted your attention to your chest, where you, Undyne *and* Alphys could see your SOUL lit up *through your body*, cracked to pieces.

[ 0 / 20 HP. ]

You felt your SOUL split apart...

[ * But... ]
[ * Y/N's SOUL refuses to yield. ]

...before the pieces slammed *back together* with force, your body lighting up at the same time, shimmering with the same purple light, time speeding back up as you staggered backward. Your body surged with magical energy, a roar in your ears as your SOUL, your *perseverence*, fought to keep you from falling apart.

A gasp had your eyes snap back up to Undyne. She was staring at you in a mix of astonishment and horror. "H-How are you still standing?! Your HP is literally zero!"

You gathered your breath to respond--

Before Jevil suddenly appeared between you and the captain, snarling at her. Several spade bullets hovered in the air already, ready to strike. "You *fiend*! You would *dare* to lay your hands on an innocent?!"

"Wh- Humans aren't innocent!" The captain spat back at him. "They're the ones that put us down--"

You could feel the intent before the action. "Jevil, don't-!" you called out, your hand shooting out even as you clutched your chest.

But Jevil was already launching his barrage of spade bullets--

A purple magical barrier phased in between the two monsters, and as it absorbed Jevil's attack against Undyne, you felt each blow, tanking each hit even as your SOUL was trying to break itself apart. Your purple sheen flickered with each hit your shield absorbed.

[ 0 / 20 HP. ]
[ * Y/N's resolve holds. ]

You grunted, pushing through the pain as best you could. You had to resolve this, *now*. While you were still standing, while your soul was fighting itself to stay together. "Jevil, we can't!" You told him. "We don't... ugh... we don't need to fight anymore. We're free here... you told me yourself. But to keep that freedom we need to coexist with these people. ...Undyne..." Your eyes flickered back to her, slightly dulled. "I know my soul means a lot right now. ...But give me a chance, please. There'll always be more humans. More deserving humans. We... can at least help make life down here more bearable."

You were beginning to feel weak, dropping to your knees even as your perseverence fought to keep you alive, burning through your magical supply. This prompted Alphys to finally kick into action, running to find you some sort of food.

"...You just..." Undyne began, swallowing. "...You just stopped him from attacking me."

A moment of quiet, punctuated by the heavy breathing of the three of you.

"...You're for real, aren't you?" She finally said, lowering her spear.

"Ha HA!" Jevil suddenly called, summoning more spades. "Never let your guard--"

[ 0 / 20 HP. ]
[ * Y/N's resolve is failing. Heal now to prevent SOUL loss. ]

He stopped, the spade bullets flickering away as you slumped against his back. Your hand was still out, trying to keep the barrier blocking his and Undyne's attacks summoned. He could tell - whatever powerful fusion magic you had cast to prolong your survival by burning through mana wouldn't last. In fact you would expire faster if your physical form deteriorated through trying to both hold yourself together and preventing him from attacking your would-be killer.

Jevil sighed deeply, glaring at the fish monster. "...My friend's life is worth more than my vengeance," he said finally. "This is *not* over, over."

Then there was a scythe in his hand, and as he opened a portal to the lab's living space and kitchen, he scooped you up into his arms and stepping through, the portal closing up after him.

The shield barrier dissipated.

And Undyne was left alone in the main lab.

The spear fizzled away as she dispelled it, letting out a deep sigh.

The tense encounter was over.

Not in the way she had initially wanted, with the human soul escaping (and staying intact, she found herself hoping).

But the human had refused to harm her. Had refused to let *another monster* harm her, even though it hurt them to do so.

...Maybe this outcome was for the best.

She unrooted herself from the ground and went to retrieve Alphys.

-----

The two found you laid down on the couch in the living area, whole and intact and asleep. The shimmer and glow of magic was gone, and a quick CHECK showed you had at least managed to eat a couple monster candies, your HP no longer at zero, and your SOUL had stitched itself back together.

Jevil sat next to your head, caring for you while you recovered from your exhaustion, an odd look on his face as he considered your situation. He glanced up briefly at the two monsters as they approached (glaring at Undyne as she passed by), Alphys setting down a cup of noodles nearby your resting place before she and Undyne took their own seats, but quickly resumed his vigil.

The room was silent for a minute as they took in your condition. "I-is... she okay?" Alphys quietly asked.

"She has eaten," the jester said, equally as quiet. "She will recover."

Alphys nodded, relieved. "Good. That was... tense."

Jevil nodded, caressing a glove through your head fur. "That was... a lot of magic she went through holding herself together like that."

Another moment of silence.

"Are... we cool?" Undyne prodded. "That was... there's no need for combat between monsters. Besides, I've been hearing you're giving the Snowdin Unit a real workout with your antics."

His face when the jester looked toward her was full of distrust. Eventually he sighed, and nodded. "We're... 'cool'. For now, for now. *But*," he suddenly snapped, "there is *no need* for combat with *her* either." He gestured toward your sleeping form.

Undyne glanced at him with widened eyes before, sighing, fixing her gaze on Jevil. "Alright... look. That's not my decision. I have... my own issues with humans, Jevil. But... under law, their souls are forfeited to Asgore. Simply put, seven human souls created the barrier that put us down here, so seven human souls will break us out. Humans killed the royal children, so they must pay in *some* fashion. Okay? That's just how it is. But..." 

Her gaze flickered over to you, sleeping more peacefully now, your face nestled against the jester's hip. "... clearly Alphys sees something different in her to want to apply for an exemption, and maybe Asgore does too, to want to go along with this, who knows. Asgore sent me here to assess any immediate threat to the Underground from her, especially before he sees her and makes his own decision. And, well..."

She sighed, conflicted. "She preferred to use her words more than action, defence and evasion more than offense. Refused to lay a hand on me... So, since I can't talk to her right now... Maybe you can fill in some of the gaps for us. How is it you're a monster like us, but you're not made of the same, I guess magic? Is she the same? Is that what makes you and her so...?" The captain trailed off, referring to their capability. 

Jevil shook his head. "...We are both Darkners," he began to explain. "'Objects come to life'. Monsters yes, born from the Dark. Once, I believed that the Card Kingdom, my home, was a real place. Alas! I am but one in a deck of cards. I only have life due to the whims of one spreading Darkness to the Light. I was locked up for this revelation! Told I was mad, mad!"

"In my wish to break free of the game I was trapped in, I reached out and used my new knowledge, my new understanding of reality to switch places with a Lightner, one from the 'real' world of our universe. How was I to know that I would instead reach out to a whole other reality!" He gestured toward you, pausing upon realising your head had nestled into his hip. After a pause in which the jester felt his cheeks heat up in a blush, he continued on, subconsciously curling his tail around you. "Ahem! I of course soon found my own way back and chose to hide myself within my signature weapon, the Devilsknife! And witnessed how the human I trapped in my place did their best to make a new life, to persevere in the world they had been forced into! One priorly unaware of magic entirely, bonding with monsters and humans alike!"

"..." He paused then, having been about to mention the hero who was possessed and the entity controlling things. But this wasn't the game anymore, was it? As his bonded friend had said, they were free of the game now. 

He decided to reword the encounter. "But there was one who grew jealous, participating through their puppet, but not truly experiencing the world they saw! They attempted to slay the wayward human soul, and I chose to rescue them and execute a plan, a plan to free ourselves of the game we were trapped in! Through which we found our way here, to this underground society!" He grinned and sat back, waiting for the monsters' reaction.

Alphys had heard parts of this before, but hearing the whole story (as Jevil told it, anyway) put your experience in a new light. Undyne's brows were furrowed as she processed the idea of a separate monster kingdom, based on a literal deck of cards.

Eventually, though, the captain did ask something. "Wait, so, why didn't you send the human back into their body, then?"

"Oh, it died," he replied casually with a wave of his hand.

She blinked. "....ooooookay. And... why are they in this 'darkner' body now? They don't really fit the theme of a card deck or whatever..."

"Correct, correct! But every Darkner has a counterpart in the Light World! 'Objects come to life', remember? The Prince of Dark fabricated a vessel for the loose SOUL, finding an appropriate counterpart to bind her to, so she could continue to live, a gracious gift for all she has done for me and them!"

"Okay, but SOUL vessels are magic based. And she clearly has magic, but there's no way a human soul can power something like that."

Alphys suddenly gasped. "W-which is why you bonded with her!" she realised. "Her construct was formed in such a way that you shared your magic with her!"

"What?" Undyne shot a glance at the scientist. "But that *can't* be possible, it's unheard of. Surely the magic required to sustain an entirely separate body, casting its own magic would be..." Her good eye widened, and she focused again on you and Jevil, as you shifted in your sleep.

Jevil's only response was a sly, "I can do anything."

"Let's n-not forget that we don't know what that other reality is like," Alphys pointed out. "If magic expenditure is the same there as it is here, ambient magic saturation, how mana reserves function there... We already know monsters themselves are different there, so it's possible that... hm..."

"Focus, Alphys." Undyne took a breath. "Okay, so they... spent time in your body, and then you got them a new monster body when you brought them here. Were you aware when you brought them here that humans were to be harvested for their souls?".

Alphys winced at the wording. "'Harvested' is a bit much..."

The jester simply shook his head. "We were only focused on escaping our prison, prison!"

"Well, you've only landed in a different kind of prison," Undyne grumbled. "Did Alphys give you a rundown on *why* we're underground?"

"I-I told him when we discovered her SOUL," Alphys responded. "When we went to talk with him, he was bringing her body out of this... portal he'd made."

Undyne blinked, surprised. She turned to the scientist. "Wait, you... followed protocol, right? Because... right now it sounds like you... harboured a human in secret."

"O-Of course I followed protocol, I'm not stupid!" Alphys snapped, and then immediately shrank back. "S-sorry. I-I got Jevil's testimony and then reported straight to King Asgore."

"Doctor, doctor!" Jevil cried, scandalised.

"I *know*, alright! It's not as simple as pretending I don't have the thing everyone wants hiding in a back room!" She buried her face in her hands, taking deep breaths. "It... it was Asgore that told me to simply monitor the situation. If the vessel failed to contain the soul, w-we get one soul closer to freedom. I-if you had lied to us and the soul was hostile, we'd have no qualms just taking it and dealing with you if *you* turned hostile. But, if she could coexist with monsters like you said... Asgore and I determined that it *could* be a boon to the Underground community, the whole... B-barrier issue notwithstanding."

Undyne stared at her for a short moment, then huffed and looked away. "Damnit King Fluffybuns, you sentimental old goat... He only gave me the order to investigate *today*."

"Because t-they awoke early this morning. W-which I also reported once I did some initial tests."

"Okay. ...okay." Undyne slouched back in her chair. "So despite the fact that we are *keeping a human soul we need for the barrier alive* and the Guard should have known sooner, this is all... above board, I *guess*. Nngaaaaaah." She stared up at the ceiling for a long moment.

"F-for what it's worth, Undyne... I do understand your frustration. A l-lot of things about this are unprecedented."

"You do know that if the kingdom decides to spare her, it's going to be that much harder to get *other* human souls for the barrier, right?" Undyne was still looking at the ceiling. 

"Humans look like humans," Jevil waved off. "My friend here already blends in."

"...I suppose I didn't realise she was human until Alphys pointed me in her direction for assessment and I uh... Hey, sorry for flipping out at you and Mettaton earlier, Alphys."

"I-it's okay," the doctor replied easily. "Again, I get it..."

Undyne nodded, sighed. "Well, I'd still like to get a statement from her, but after all *that*, I guess she'll be a while, huh."

"W-well, how do you suppose we pass the time?" Alphys raised an eyebrow. 

----

Your eyes blinked open about three hours deep into an impromptu anime marathon happening around you. 

Next to your head was Jevil, faced away, thoroughly engaged in whatever battle was occurring on the screen he was blocking. 

You could hear but not see Alphys, somewhere past where your head lay against/under the arm of the couch.

Who you *could* see, though, past your feet in another lounge chair, was Undyne the fish warrior.

Whom, mid-cheer for whatever was on the screen, caught your slow movements in her limited vision, her head turning toward you. "Huh. The sprat's awake."

You couldn't help the little jolt of fear through your limbs as she locked onto you.
