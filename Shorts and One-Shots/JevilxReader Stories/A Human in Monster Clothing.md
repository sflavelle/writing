You're not quite sure when you realise you're conscious.

What came to you first?
Was it the hum of fluorescent lights somewhere above?
The sensation of sluggishness that permeated your being, born of your coma state?
The texture of the sheet draped over your fur?

...huh?

You groan and slowly shift in your bed, slowly blinking your eyes open.

The room is dark, but not pitch black. A light - the fluorescent tube light you hear is somewhere to your right, seemingly through a doorway - allowing the ability to see, but not blind you. Slowly, you turn your head to face the light with a yawn, moving your arm in preparation to shade your eyes. Yep, that's fur.

(You vaguely remember being told that you were given a new body, a vessel for your soul, so you don't freak too much.)

(Part of you thinks you probably *should* examine your vessel now, but you figure you can do that whenever.)

Getting a better look at the room, it seems reminiscent of a hospital ward. But... you're the only one here, and - you check behind you - there are no windows.

You wonder where Jevil left you. And on that note, just where the jester had gone off to himself.

You slowly lift the sheets covering you to the side. Yep, that's more fur. White and light shades of brown. You lift yourself up and without thinking further, you shift your body to the side and lift off the bed and onto your feet with a loud 'clack' as your feet(?) land on the tiled floor.

You flinch, your legs snapping back up off the ground. The harsh noise takes you completely by surprise. you look at yourself...

Oh. Those are... those are the animal kinda legs, not the 'furry' human-like ones your brain was expecting. What was the term? Digitigrade? Yeah? No, the other one. Ani... pluh... Plantigrade. Plantigrade! Yeah, that sounded right.

Welp guess you suddenly had to learn to walk with legs that didn't bend the way you're used to. Fuck.

And... you had hooves. So that was what you heard - hard... bone? Keratin? You weren't awake/alive enough for this shit - that made up your feet hitting the floor.

Well, this was going to be something.

----

It took you longer than you felt comfortable admitting to get across the room, from the bed to the doorway, but at least your legs seemed strong... enough.

They held you - if you held yourself right. And you weren't quite used to how this new body wanted to be held, just yet.

You're glad nobody's seen you yet.

Though the dim blinking LED of a security camera, unnoticed by you in your struggle, begs to differ.

You decide to keep trying, turning around and slowly, with more confidence than previously, stepping back over to the bed.

Immediately you sat on the thin mattress once you reached it, giving your aching lower half a break. You were panting, if only because for part of the process of getting to and from the door you had been holding your breath. (That was a you thing, annoyingly.) You were starting to understand how your new legs worked... Starting to.

As you started to settle again, you became aware of the sound of footsteps - someone padding down the corridor outside the door toward you, gentle thumps with a clicking noise to it. Ah, people *do* exist here. Perhaps Jevil, through whatever soul connection you two had, had noticed you had awoken.

Their shadow appeared in the doorway shortly before the person it belonged to.

It was not Jevil.

This monster, however, you *did* know - if only through osmosis.

She gave a little squeak as she noticed you already looking at her, adjusting the glasses over her yellow snout so her vision was clear. After a deep breath, she walked over to you, her claws clicking against the tiled floor. She looked quite tired, and you couldn't help but wonder whether it was dark here because it was late at night, or you (and evidently everyone else here) were underground... You wondered separately, whether she was overworked at the same time...

You prepared to listen carefully to what Alphys, the Underground's Royal Scientist, had to tell you.

"G-good evening," the lizard greeted with a nervous smile. "It's good t-to see you finally awake. Welcome to the Lab, you can c-call me Dr. Alphys." She consulted the clipboard she had been holding to her side. "Um, a monster by the name of Jevil has deposited you in my care a few days ago after you both arrived from, he said another world...? Uh, b-but th-that's not important right now! I-it uhm, just means you'll need an introduction to the Underground! A-anyway, from my understanding you've been through a lot?"

...Okay, so Jevil had just so happened to discover the Undertale universe, and had dropped you off here of all places where he went to do... something? You nodded. "Yeah... that's right. Considering the last memory i remember after such a long, erm sleep was..." You wracked your brain. "Uh... getting stabbed."

Alphys just stared at you blankly. "I... Well, you uh... Seem? To be alive? Ahem. Well. It is... quite late in the evening, so I hope you'll understand that will run some checkups on you at a more... reasonable hour." She chuckles. 

You blinked, then nodded, smiling warmly. "Oh, no stress at all! I completely understand that. Perhaps some quick introductions then and I can let you, ahh, return to sleep or something?"

"Heh, u-um, actually I haven't been to bed yet." The lizard seemed embarrassed. If you had to guess the rough time, it must have been super late at night. "I was just about to um... make a snack and wind down with a few episodes of t-the show I'm watching at the moment..." She paused, and her expression shifted briefly. Was she nervous? "If you, um... don't feel tired at the moment, y-you could... join me in the living space...?"
