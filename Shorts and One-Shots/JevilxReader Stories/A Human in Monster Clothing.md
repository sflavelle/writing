You're not quite sure when you realise you're conscious.

What came to you first?
Was it the hum of fluorescent lights somewhere above?
The sensation of sluggishness that permeated your being, born of your prior coma state?
The texture of the sheet draped over your fur?

...huh?

You groan and slowly shift in your bed, slowly blinking your eyes open.

The room is dark, but not pitch black. A light - the fluorescent tube light you hear is somewhere to your right, seemingly through a doorway - allowing the ability to see, but not blind you. Slowly, you turn your head to face the light with a yawn, moving your arm in preparation to shade your eyes. Yep, that's fur.

(You vaguely remember being told that you were given a new body, a vessel for your soul, so you don't freak too much.)

(Part of you thinks you probably *should* examine your vessel now, but you figure you can do that whenever.)

Getting a better look at the room, it seems reminiscent of a hospital ward. But... you're the only one here, and - you check behind you - there are no windows.

You wonder where Jevil left you. And on that note, just where the jester had gone off to himself.

You slowly lift the sheets covering you to the side. Yep, that's more fur. White and light shades of brown. You lift yourself up and without thinking further, you shift your body to the side and lift off the bed and onto your feet with a loud 'clack' as your feet(?) land on the tiled floor.

You flinch, your legs snapping back up off the ground. The harsh noise takes you completely by surprise. you look at yourself...

Oh. Those are... those are the animal kinda legs, not the 'furry' human-like ones your brain was expecting. What was the term? Digitigrade? Yeah? No, the other one. Ani... pluh... Plantigrade. Plantigrade! Yeah, that sounded right.

Welp guess you suddenly had to learn to walk with legs that didn't bend the way you're used to. Fuck.

And... you had hooves. So that was what you heard - hard... bone? Keratin? You weren't awake/alive enough for this shit - that made up your feet hitting the floor.

Well, this was going to be something.

----

It took you longer than you felt comfortable admitting to get across the room, from the bed to the doorway, but at least your legs seemed strong... enough.

They held you - if you held yourself right. And you weren't quite used to how this new body wanted to be held, just yet.

You're glad nobody's seen you yet.

Though the dim blinking LED of a security camera, unnoticed by you in your struggle, begs to differ.

You decide to keep trying, turning around and slowly, with more confidence than previously, stepping back over to the bed.

Immediately you sat on the thin mattress once you reached it, giving your aching lower half a break. You were panting, if only because for part of the process of getting to and from the door you had been holding your breath. (That was a you thing, annoyingly.) You were starting to understand how your new legs worked... Starting to.

As you started to settle again, you became aware of the sound of footsteps - someone padding down the corridor outside the door toward you, gentle thumps with a clicking noise to it. Ah, people *do* exist here. Perhaps Jevil, through whatever soul connection you two had, had noticed you had awoken.

Their shadow appeared in the doorway shortly before the person it belonged to.

It was not Jevil.

This monster, however, you *did* know - if only through osmosis.

She gave a little squeak as she noticed you already looking at her, adjusting the glasses over her yellow snout so her vision was clear. After a deep breath, she walked over to you, her claws clicking against the tiled floor. She looked quite tired, and you couldn't help but wonder whether it was dark here because it was late at night, or you (and evidently everyone else here) were underground... You wondered separately, whether she was overworked at the same time...

You prepared to listen carefully to what Alphys, the Underground's Royal Scientist, had to tell you.

"G-good evening," the lizard greeted with a nervous smile. "It's good t-to see you finally awake. Welcome to the Lab, you can c-call me Dr. Alphys." She consulted the clipboard she had been holding to her side. "Um, a monster by the name of Jevil has deposited you in my care a few days ago after you both arrived from, he said another world...? Uh, b-but th-that's not important right now! I-it uhm, just means you'll need an introduction to the Underground! A-anyway, from my understanding you've been through a lot?"

...Okay, so Jevil had just so happened to discover the Undertale universe (or *an* Undertale universe? Who knew what bullshit you were dealing with now), and had dropped you off here of all places where he went to do... something? You nodded. "Yeah... that's right. Considering the last memory i remember after such a long, erm sleep was..." You wracked your brain. "Uh... getting stabbed."

Alphys just stared at you blankly. "I... Well, you uh... Seem? To be alive? Ahem. Well. It is... quite late in the evening, so I hope you'll understand that I will keep this short. I uh, figure introductions now would be good and we'll run some checkups on you at a more... reasonable hour." She chuckles. 

You blinked, then nodded, smiling warmly. "Oh, no stress at all! I completely understand that. Perhaps some quick introductions then and I can let you, ahh, return to sleep or something?"

"Heh, u-um, actually I haven't been to bed yet." The lizard seemed embarrassed. If you had to guess the rough time, it must have been super late at night. "I was just about to um... make a snack and wind down with a few episodes of t-the show I'm watching at the moment..." She paused, and her expression shifted briefly. Was she nervous? "If you, um... don't feel tired at the moment, y-you could... join me in the living space if you feel hungry...?"

You felt at your stomach. "I don't... feel terribly hungry yet, but I guess I'll need the meal. Oh, uh - I'm Y/N. Sorry, doing this all out of order," you chuckled. To be fair to yourself, you weren't you for a while there.

Alphys nervously giggled with you. "T-thats fine! You *have* been through a lot, it sounds like..."

----

You spent the next hour or so in another lab room that was repurposed as a living room space, eating a cup of noodles while watching what was apparently season 2 of an anime the doctor was watching. You both sat on the small couch (though respectfully you gave her some room) as 'Mew Mew' vowed to 'light up the darkness' through magical girl transformations or something like that. 

You fell asleep again sooner than you expected, and when you woke sometime that 'morning' you had had a blanket draped carefully over you. You were pleasantly surprised - you had no idea how long you were in Alphys' care before you woke, but you had perhaps expected for her to be less personal. Whatever the reason, though,  you were content - you weren't in immediate danger, and while Jevil had still not shown his face since you awoke, around Alphys you felt safe enough. 

Speaking of the scientist, she was fascinated with the world you had come from, and the adventure you had already endured - "That explains how you're so comfortable with all this," she said. She told you that she wanted especially to examine your 'shell' and your soul... "T-to see how it has adapted, o-of course!"

And though you weren't looking forward to exposing your soul - because it would expose your humanity underneath all the fur and borrowed magic - it turns out you didn't need to.

----

You woke the next day, after one of introductions and menial tests, to find a box towering over your bedside.

You yelped and jolted back toward the opposite edge of your bed, looking it over, eyeing the black LED panel on its front, and was about to relax, having fooled yourself into thinking you were being watched in your sleep, when the box *leaned forward* and spoke five words that chilled you to your core. 

"*We know what you are.*"

A robotic arm shot out from its side and grasped the collar of your gown, yanking you towards it. The front panel lit up, revealing itself to be a screen of sorts which lit up in red. You were shocked into silence. 

"Look like a monster all you want, darling; we've seen the *human* soul inside that makes *you* tick."

A face appeared on its screen, a low resolution smiley face. Somehow this made the situation creepier. "Do you know what happens to humans down here?" It asked, its speech dripping with a threat. 

Your own voice was small as you answered, "I-I think I have some idea ... please don't," you pleaded.

"Allow me to be crystal clear, then." It pulled you closer, toward a camera module in the top of its front panelling. "You continue to live at the good doctor's request. While you are here, you will *not* harm a single monster. If either of us *find out* you have broken this single guideline, *I will not hesitate to put your soul to better use*. Do you understand me, human?"

You had begun shaking as you responded. "C-Clear as crystal." You didn't think to add that you had already been living around monsters. 

"Good!" Immediately the robot let you go, and you collapsed backwards onto the lab bed. Its voice had already taken on a brighter tone, acting as if it had not just threatened your life. "Then it's a pleasure to make your acquaintance! How was my performance? Did I come off as dark and brooding as I intended~?"

The robot then proceeded to cut off your reply immediately and told you to call them "Mettaton". You *wanted* to call them mean names, but you kept that to yourself. Instead you gave your name between heaving breaths, trying to settle yourself. You vaguely recognised the name from the internet, but that was about it.

After the rude introduction, he wasted no time in introducing himself as *the* star of the underground, listing all his roles on the silver screen.

You weren't awake enough for this shit. 

----

"How long have you known?" You later carefully asked Alphys while you both enjoyed a lunch break from the testing of your body's magical capacity.

She paused mid-bite of her sandwich, eyes snapping up to yours. She tried to answer, somehow forgot she had food in her mouth, and then gave up and simply raised an eyebrow in question as she sorted herself out. 

"Mettaton decided to wake me up today," you explained, nervously. "Said, um... you've already *seen* my soul. You know I'm..." You trailed off, fingers brushing along the fur on your opposite forearm.

Her pupils shrank to tiny dots, and suddenly her stutter was back in full force. "I-I! Um! I'm sorry-- I never-- We..."

You leaned back with the noodle cup and patiently waited for her to explain.

Alphys paused, sighing into her hands, having a moment of thought, before looking up into your eyes with a mixture of guilt and nervousness. "...Y/N, i-it's *okay*," she said carefully. "I *know*. He... ...Jevil wasn...wasn't careful about keeping your soul hidden before you were given this vessel. I've *seen* the shape of your soul."

...Maybe you should've known that Jevil was the kind of monster to play fast-and-loose with other people's things.

You stared at her briefly, but slumped back in your chair, staring up at the ceiling. You exhaled slowly, then took a deep breath to collect your thoughts. "...Fuck," you finally settled on.

Alphys giggled despite the tense moment. After calming herself down and taking a few breaths, she finally managed to get the words out. "I-it was an accident. Um, J-Jevil - When... when you were just a soul, we kept him to a room like you have -- h-he must have carried you around with him, but he um, I don't think he knew I kept surveillance in the lab. He um... when he was alone in that room, I guess he just, had your soul out sometimes? T-to talk to you or something? M-Mettaton was the first to notice it, when um, when he would come by for maintenance."

"And then there was one day, we went to visit him and there was just? A hole? In the wall? Not that he broke the wall, no-- it was like... a window to somewhere else entirely... And he came out of it carrying your body as it is now. And he asked me to look after you like we d-did for him. I um, I think he's a couple towns away at the moment? I think he may be looking for somewhere for you both to stay."

"So..." You sighed and glanced away. "Sounds like maybe he didn't know or care about... um, the whole situation here." You slurped up some of the noodles. "I want to be mad... But I suppose I didn't expect much from him. So then... So how long have I been here, then...? Or I guess, how long have you known about me?"
