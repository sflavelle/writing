You're not quite sure when you realise you're conscious.

What came to you first?
Was it the hum of fluorescent lights somewhere above?
The sensation of sluggishness that permeated your being, born of your coma state?
The texture of the sheet draped over your fur?

...huh?

You groan and slowly shift in your bed, slowly blinking your eyes open.

The room is dark, but not pitch black. A light - the fluorescent tube light you hear is somewhere to your right, seemingly through a doorway - allowing the ability to see, but not blind you. Slowly, you turn your head to face the light with a yawn, moving your arm in preparation to shade your eyes. Yep, that's fur.

(You vaguely remember being told that you were given a new body, a vessel for your soul, so you don't freak too much.)

(Part of you thinks you probably *should* examine your vessel now, but you figure you can do that whenever.)

Getting a better look at the room, it seems reminiscent of a hospital ward. But... you're the only one here, and - you check behind you - there are no windows.

You wonder where Jevil left you. And on that note, just where the jester had gone off to himself.

You slowly lift the sheets covering you to the side. Yep, that's more fur. White and light shades of brown. You lift yourself up and without thinking further, you shift your body to the side and lift off the bed and onto your feet with a loud 'clack' as your feet(?) land on the tiled floor.

You flinch, your legs snapping back up off the ground. The harsh noise takes you completely by surprise. you look at yourself...

Oh. Those are... those are the animal kinda legs, not the 'furry' ones you were expecting. What was the term? Digitigrade? Yeah? No, the other one. Ani... pluh... Plantigrade. Plantigrade! Yeah, that sounded right.

Welp guess you suddenly had to learn to walk with legs that didn't bend the way you're used to. Fuck.

----

It took you longer than you felt comfortable admitting to get across the room, from the bed to the doorway, but at least your legs seemed strong... enough.

They held you - if you held yourself right. And you weren't quite used to how this new body wanted to be held, just yet.

You're glad nobody's seen you yet.

Though the dim blinking LED of a security camera, unnoticed by you in your struggle, begs to differ.
