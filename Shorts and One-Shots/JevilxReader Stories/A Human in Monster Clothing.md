You're not quite sure when you realise you're conscious.

What came to you first?
Was it the hum of fluorescent lights somewhere above?
The sensation of sluggishness that permeated your being, born of your prior coma state?
The texture of the sheet draped over your fur?

...huh? *Fur*?

You groan and slowly shift in your bed, slowly blinking your eyes open.

The room is dark, but not pitch black. A light - the fluorescent tube light you hear is somewhere to your right, seemingly through a doorway - allowing the ability to see, but not blind you. Slowly, you turn your head to face the light with a yawn, moving your arm in preparation to shade your eyes. Yep, that's fur.

(You vaguely remember being told that you were given a new body, a vessel for your soul, so you don't freak too much - but you feel... strange.)

(Part of you thinks you probably *should* examine your vessel. But... that can wait until you've examined whereever you are a bit more.)

Getting a better look at the room, it seems reminiscent of a hospital ward. But... you're the only one here, and - you check behind you - there are no windows.

You wonder where Jevil left you. And for that matter, just where the jester had gone off to himself.

You slowly lift the sheets covering you to the side. Yep, that's more fur. White and light shades of brown. You lift yourself up and without thinking further, you shift your body to the side and lift off the bed and onto your feet with a loud 'clack' as your feet(?) land on the tiled floor.

You flinch, your legs snapping back up off the ground. The harsh noise takes you completely by surprise. you look at yourself...

Oh. Those are... those are the animal kinda legs, not the 'furry' human-like ones your brain was expecting. What was the term? Digitigrade? Yeah? No, the other one. Ani... pluh... Plantigrade. Plantigrade! Yeah, that sounded right.

Welp guess you suddenly had to learn to walk with legs that didn't bend the way you're used to. Fuck.

And... you had hooves. So that was what you heard - hard... bone? Keratin? You weren't awake/alive enough for this shit - that made up your feet hitting the floor.

Well, this was going to be something.

----

It took you longer than you felt comfortable admitting to get across the room, from the bed to the doorway, but at least your legs seemed strong... enough.

They held you - if you held yourself right. And you weren't quite used to how this new body wanted to be held, just yet.

You're glad nobody's seen you yet.

Though the dim blinking LED of a security camera, unnoticed by you in your struggle, begs to differ.

You decide to keep trying, turning around and slowly, with more confidence than previously, stepping back over to the bed.

Immediately you sat on the thin mattress once you reached it, giving your aching lower half a break. You were panting, if only because for part of the process of getting to and from the door you had been holding your breath. (That was a you thing, annoyingly.) You were starting to understand how your new legs worked... Starting to.

As you started to settle again, you became aware of a humming gradually increasing in volume. After some racking your brain about it, you placed the sound of doors sliding open, and realised an elevator had arrived.

Then there was the sound of footsteps - someone padding down the corridor outside the door toward you, gentle thumps with a clicking noise to it. Ah, people *do* exist here. Perhaps Jevil, through whatever soul connection you two had, had noticed you had awoken.

Their shadow appeared in the doorway shortly before the person it belonged to.

It was not Jevil.

This monster, however, you *did* know - if only through osmosis.

She gave a little squeak as she noticed you already looking at her, adjusting the glasses over her yellow snout so her vision was clear. After a deep breath, she walked over to you, her claws clicking against the tiled floor. She looked quite tired, and you couldn't help but wonder whether it was dark here because it was late at night, or you (and evidently everyone else here) were underground... You wondered separately, whether she was overworked at the same time...

You prepared to listen carefully to what Alphys, the Underground's Royal Scientist, had to tell you.

"G-good evening," the lizard greeted with a nervous smile. "It's good t-to see you finally awake. Welcome to the Lab, you can c-call me Dr. Alphys." She consulted the clipboard she had been holding to her side. "Um, a monster by the name of Jevil has deposited you in my care a few days ago after you both arrived from, he said another world...? Uh, b-but th-that's not important right now! I-it uhm, just means you'll need an introduction to the Underground! A-anyway, from my understanding you've been through a lot?"

...Okay, so Jevil had just so happened to discover the Undertale universe (or *an* Undertale universe? Who knew what bullshit you were dealing with now), and had dropped you off here of all places where he went to do... something? You nodded. "Yeah... that's right. Considering the last memory i remember after such a long, erm sleep was..." You wracked your brain. "Uh... getting stabbed."

Alphys just stared at you blankly. "I... Well, you uh... Seem? To be alive? Ahem. Well. It is... quite late in the evening, so I hope you'll understand that I will keep this short. I uh, figure introductions now would be good and we'll run some checkups on you at a more... reasonable hour." She chuckles. 

You blinked, then nodded, smiling warmly. "Oh, no stress at all! I completely understand that. Perhaps some quick introductions then and I can let you, ahh, return to sleep or something?"

"Heh, u-um, actually I haven't been to bed yet." The lizard seemed embarrassed. If you had to guess the rough time, it must have been super late at night. "I was just about to um... make a snack and wind down with a few episodes of t-the show I'm watching at the moment..." She paused, and her expression shifted briefly. Was she nervous? "If you, um... don't feel tired at the moment, y-you could... join me in the living space upstairs if you feel hungry...?"

You felt at your stomach. "I don't... feel terribly hungry yet, but I guess I'll need the meal. Oh, uh - I'm Y/N. Sorry, doing this all out of order," you chuckled. To be fair to yourself, you weren't you for a while there.

Alphys nervously giggled with you. "T-thats fine! You *have* been through a lot, it sounds like..."

----

You spent the next hour or so in an upstairs lab room that was repurposed as a living room space, eating from a cup of noodles while watching what was apparently season 2 of an anime the doctor was watching. You both sat on the small couch (though respectfully you gave her some room) as 'Mew Mew' vowed to 'light up the darkness' through magical girl transformations or something like that. 

You fell asleep again sooner than you expected, and when you woke sometime that 'morning' you had had a blanket draped carefully over you. You were pleasantly surprised - you had no idea how long you were in Alphys' care before you woke, but you had perhaps expected for her to be less personal. Whatever the reason, though,  you were content - you weren't in immediate danger, and while Jevil had still not shown his face since you awoke, around Alphys you felt safe enough. 

Speaking of the scientist, she was fascinated with the world you had come from, and the adventure you had already endured - "That explains how you're so comfortable with all this," she said. She told you that she wanted especially to examine your 'shell' and your soul... "T-to see how it has adapted, o-of course!"

And you weren't looking forward to having your soul exposed - because it would expose your humanity underneath all the fur and borrowed magic. You didn't know much about souls, even after your time in the Card Kingdom, but you *did* know that souls from humans looked noticeably different from monster souls.

You tried to dance around the subject with details of your previous adventure - she was shocked to learn that the monster you had arrived in the Underground with had previously soul-swapped with you to escape 'un-imprisonment' - but Alphys of course soon caught on. 

"I just don't see what my soul is going to tell you," you'd said awkwardly in the main room, finishing your breakfast noodles.

"Well," she began, "It'll tell us a fair bit about your stats, certain traits you might possess, your soul color... it might even tell us about potential differences in monsters and humans from your world compared to ours!"

"What do humans have to do with this?" You cocked your head to the side.

"Uh, w-well, y'know..." Alphys vaguely gestured at you, looking away in embarrassment.

"...No, I don't," you said carefully, but your sudden guarded, nervous expression betrayed your concern. "I-I mean, clearly I'm not..."

Alphys sighed, and took a deep breath. "...Y/N, i-it's *okay*," she said carefully. "I... I *know* you have a human soul." 
 
 You paused, full fork touching your lips, your irises pinpricks.

"He... ...Jevil wasn...wasn't careful about keeping your soul hidden before you were given this vessel. I've *seen* the shape of your soul."

...Maybe you should've known that Jevil was the kind of monster to play fast-and-loose with other people's things.

You stared at her for a few long moments, but then you slurped up the noodles, then slumped back in your chair, staring up at the ceiling. You exhaled slowly, then took a deep breath to collect your thoughts. "...Fuck," you finally settled on.

Alphys snorted, despite the tense moment. After calming herself down and taking a few breaths, having managed to breach the subject, she finally managed to get the words out. "I-it was an accident. Um, J-Jevil - When... when you were just a soul, we kept him to a room like you have -- h-he must have carried you around with him, but he um, I don't think he knew I kept surveillance in the lab. He um... when he was alone in that room, I guess he just, had your soul out sometimes? T-to talk to you or something? M-Mettaton was the first to notice it, when um, when he would come by for maintenance."

"And then there was one day, I went to visit him and there was just? A hole? In the wall? Not that he broke the wall, no-- it was like... a window to somewhere else entirely... And he came out of it carrying your body as it is now. And he asked me to look after you like we d-did for him. I um, I think he's a couple towns away at the moment? I think he may be looking for somewhere for you both to stay."

You were silent for a minute, processing what she told you as you finished eating. She had known for... some amount of time, that you were definitely human, and in fact that for a time you had been just a soul. In a world where - you recall vaguely - these monsters needed human souls to break free from the Underground, you were surprised that you were still here. Your eyebrows raised as you thought. Was it because of a threat of Jevil's power? Did Alphys feel some obligation that succeeded her own duty to the crown?

You finished off your noodle cup, and set it aside. "...Right," you finally said, fixing your gaze on her. "But I take it my presence isn't exactly... ideal." You spoke vaguely, since you were at least aware that you weren't *supposed* to be aware of certain things here yet.

Alphys hissed through her teeth, glancing away again. She made a hand gesture 'so-so'. "Well yes... and no." She sighed, and looked back. "Because of... certain events that have happened over the course of monster existence, we are trapped here under the earth because of humans. We are getting close to freeing ourselves, but so far, the best method that we have of doing so is... well, um, c-collecting the souls of fallen h-humans." Her eyes snapped away again. "W-we have... uh... five so far. We need... seven."

"...I see." You nodded quietly, leaning back in your seat to stare up at the roof of the lab. "...Am I going to be one of them?"

Alphys was silent at first.

Your expression sank.

"...T-that's what I want to find out," she finally said, in a quiet voice. "By... by law, all human souls are to be taken to A-Asgore, our king. Their power is... that is, the power of their souls... is required to break the Barrier. As... humans were the ones that put us down here. The ones that um... were responsible for the d-deaths of his children."

"Oh, shit." You bit your lip. "I... can understand why he wouldn't be happy with them then."

She nodded. "But you're not from the surface, are you? Not our surface. ...If... you'd let me learn about you, and do some tests... I could make a case for an exception for you. You... seem nice enough. O-or at least, you haven't tried to kill me." She awkwardly chuckled, trying to lighten the mood.

You responded to the latter remark with a raised eyebrow. "Well... let me know what I can do to help you, I suppose. Uh - short of giving my life, of course." You had to at least return Alphys' awkward light-making joke.

She nodded, and smiled lightly.

----

And so, you allowed yourself to be examined for the rest of the day. Alphys was thorough with her work - examining your soul's condition, noting its prominent Perseverance trait, followed by gentle CHECKs and probes to determine your statistics.

Then she moved on to taking a look at the matter that comprised your soul vessel. She found herself confused but fascinated by your body being made not of pure magic, but *darkness* - something close to, but not quite Void. You had to remind yourself that it was because it was Ralsei the Prince of Darkness that had created this vessel to hold your soul. It was veins *within* the dark vessel that carried the magic through the body and protected the soul. Your magical link with Jevil was also found in this examination - a pool of magical energy that ebbed and flowed gently *around* your soul as your body used it, replenished from some unseen source.

Between discussions around the tests that she was doing, she also talked to you about *you* - talking about behaviors, interests (she got excited when you told her you were into computers). She cocked an eyebrow as you mentioned that you had an intellectual disorder, then interrupted you while you were mentioning your difficulty understanding body language and your brain being wired up slightly differently to tell you that she had seen that in some monsters regularly. (Knowledge gained, monsters knew about autism.)

While you and Alphys were in the midst of debating and debunking human behaviors from her 'history tapes' (more anime) you were interrupted by the doors into the lab slamming open dramatically, followed by a new voice.

"ALPHYS, DARLING~! I'M HERE FOR MY SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE!"

"Oh, whoops," Alphys muttered, then looked up at you, a blush forming on her cheeks. "Sorry Y/N, I'll have to wrap this up for now." She finished writing something on her clipboard, then called out as she stood, "Over here, Mettaton! S-sorry, I got distracted!"

"What with, my dear?" The effeminate voice asked, getting closer, until they rounded the corner and stopped, seemingly seeing you.

...Well, you weren't sure what kind of monster you expected Mettaton to be, but this wasn't it.

"Oh!" The rectangular robot scooted forward on his wheel to get up close to you. "You're awake! How delighted I am to meet you, my dear... deer." He chuckled lightly, extending his telescopic arms to shake yours. "I trust you've not been keeping dear Alphys here too busy?"

"Ahah... not more than she would normally be, I assume." You nodded toward her.

"Mettaton," Alphys spoke up suddenly, "would y-you keep Y/N here entertained while I prep the usual room?"

"Of *course*, darling!" The robot bowed, exaggerating his motion slightly (at least, that's how it felt to you). "I promise you, we won't be going anywhere."

"T-thanks." She smiled nervously. "I won't be too long. Please, no arguing. O-or chainsaws."

She ducked out of the room, missing how you slowly turned your head toward the robot, raising an eyebrow. "Uh... chainsaws?"

His screen lit up in a simple smiley face. Somehow it gave you the creeps. "Be kind to her, darling, and you won't find out."

As the two of you began to chat, Alphys ducked into a nearby room, slid the door shut, then took out her phone and dialled a number. 

It rang four times before the monster on the other end responded. "Howdy, Doctor! Is everything alright?"

"Y-yes sir, I'm perfectly fine. I rang to inform... uh... t-the *subject* has awoken, Asgore."

There was a pause, followed by a heavy sigh on the other end... The sigh of a person that had hoped that he might not have to take action. "I see. Please, tell me everything you can."

----

Although at first Mettaton the robot monster was skeptical of your intentions underground - though he had to admit, being unconscious for several weeks and in fact being *revived* by a monster somehow had helped your case...

As he talked with you, sitting across the couch from each other in the main room...

The way you answered his questions the best as you were able, offering information about yourself and what you knew about why you were in the Underground (Jevil probably just ended up here and liked it?) and how you and Jevil met up (he soulswapped with you to escape imprisonment, then only jumped in to save your soul when an extradimensional entity threatened your soul/his body (yes you were upset about being manipulated))...

He felt you were at least not lying or hostile.

That didn't mean that he wasn't feeling *urges*, with your soul (and a path to stardom on the surface) right there in front of him...

But he had already been denied by Doctor Alphys, and well, with her plan explained to him, he was at least sated. It would be the same result if King Asgore used your soul for the barrier, of course.

Alphys re-entered the room after a few minutes of chatter, carrying a black piece of equipment under her arm. "Alright Mettaton, sorry to keep you waiting," she said sheepishly. "Um, Y/N, while you're waiting for us, I was wondering if you might take a look at something for me?"

She walked over to the lounge nook where you were sat and placed the device on the table. Now that you could see it more clearly, you could see that it was an old laptop from the surface. As you reached to open it, she explained, "I uh, found this in the dump last time I was down there, it looks like a type of computer but even after drying it it appears... not to work. I've got some tools on the bench over there," she cocked her head toward her workbench, "so if there's anything you can figure out about how this is put together, or if you can even repair it... anything helps." She smiled.

"Hmm, sure!" You grinned back. "I'm not *as* familiar with laptops compared to desktop machines, but it's more or less the same thing just packaged differently. I'll see what I can find."

"Aha~" The robot suddenly said to himself, an '!' appearing on his screen. "I recognise that spark in your eye! I daresay, Alphys darling, you may have found a likeminded soul. I hope, for your sake that the King is lenient in his judgment." He paused. "Wait, was I not supposed to--?"

"I know the deal, Alphys told me," you waved him off. "I'll cross that bridge when we get to it. Now I believe you have some servicing to get done... 'darling'." You couldn't help the childish act of sticking your tongue out at him, as you pulled the dead laptop toward you, examining it more closely.

----

You were left alone for the better part of an hour to look at the device and take notes. There were rust stains on the plastic casing and a few minor signs of water damage, hinting at corrosion on the internal components. You didn't know anything about what 'the dump' was like, but from clues on and inside the laptop it seemed to be a wet or at least humid environment.

Raiding from Alphys' stash of mismatched screwdrivers at her workbench, you found one that fit the laptop's small Philips screws and managed to get the underside off. You were in the process of spreading out the socketed and unscrewable components on the table...

...when the door into the lab opened, and a gust of hot air from outside rushed past you. Even that brief breath of Hotland air was stifling. "Hiya," you called, glancing briefly at the guest who had just entered before returning to your work. "Alphys is busy at the minute, I think she'll be out shortly--"

The glowing blue spear that then blocked your view of the laptop's internals got you to shut up. The side pressed at your face, prodding you to look back up at its owner.

A scowling redheaded fish woman in a black tank top and denim jeans.

You sighed, and rolled your eyes, nodding your head back toward the rear of the lab. "She's in one of the exam rooms with Mettaton."

You made to return to your work, but she interrupted you, again moving your head up with the side of her spear. "It's you, isn't it?" She growled.

"It's me?" You raised an eyebrow.

"The human!" She spat with venom. "The one Asgore told me was hiding at the labs?!"

"Huh? He-- whuh? He knows? Already? How did-- Alphys. Right." You raised an eyebrow, and straightened up, accepting that this monster wouldn't let you just return to your project. "I mean, I understand I shouldn't be here, knew there were decisions he'd have to make, but--"

"Listen up, punk." She pressed into your personal space, trapping you against the bench. "I don't know how the hell you got down here, past the guards, disguised yourself and brainwashed Alphys with your human mind-control--"

"Mind control?! The fuck?"

"But I'll be watching you. *Veeeeeery* closely." She grinned, exposing her sharp teeth as she leaned in closer. "You make a move on anyone? You're as good as dead. Clear?"

Fucking hell, this woman was intimidating, but also fuck, couldn't she see you *weren't* moving on anyone? "Crystal," you finally said flatly, your expression unamused.

"*Good.*" She grabbed you by the scruff of your shirt and shoved you in front of her. "Now. Take me to Alphys. No funny business."

You sighed. "Lucky for you, I'm not funny," you quipped as you led her further into the labs.

You both walked til you came to the second door on your right. You knocked twice, calling out, "Hey sorry to bother, we um... have someone here?"

"DAMN RIGHT YA DO!" The monster behind you yelled, startling you as she pushed you aside and swung the door open. "I'M HERE TO SAVE YOU, ALPHY!"

Alphys flinched back and fumbled the screwdriver she was using to reattach Mettaton's rear panel. "U-uhm... 'save me', Undyne?"

"The mind control THEY," she pointed at you, "put you under! How else would they get you to hide them away?!"

"Okay where the fuck is this mind control claim coming from," you grumbled as you appeared in the doorway, eyeing the fish monster - Undyne - warily. "If they can *actually* do that here, I'm sorry to hear that, but where I come from they absolutely fucking cannot."

"Oh we *know*," Undyne grinned. "We've seen your human history books! The ones where you put other humans under a spell and make them do weird things for you!"

You *sputtered*, barely managing not to spit-take. Alphys, for her part, managed to look horrified at the information being volunteered. "What?!" you cried out once you had caught yourself. "Are... holy shit... are these the same as the 'history tapes' you were talking to me about earlier, Alphys?"

"Umm..." The lizard slowly shaped her expression into a sheepish smile. "M-maybe...?"

Your head went into your hands. The fish monster that wanted your soul is basing her knowledge on humans from adult graphic novels. "Perhaps," you choked out, embarrassed, "don't take your human knowledge from porn. Please."
