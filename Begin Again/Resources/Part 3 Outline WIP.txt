- 05 - The Morning After
-- Lorne wakes up, the day after Lily's kidnapping, alone
-- Assumes she's slept at Eight's place, which is nearby the Starfish Bar
-- OTH News Report featuring DJ Neu Wave's involvement in the Final Fest concert!
-- Texts Lily, but doesn't get a response back
-- Eventually calls Eight to ask if Lily crashed there last night
-- No, but he remembers her saying she stops off to check on 'a friend' after her shows
-- calls OtH to ask them, since they were at the show
-- Nope, they haven't hosted her at their place, they saw her just after the show and she seemed alright...
-- calls Remo, Lily rarely heads up to his part of town but she's starting to worry, she's not where she usually would be
-- Goes out walking, bumps into the Squid Sisters, since the boys had let them know Lorne was out of sorts
-- Lorne tells them about her distress, and Marie notes she has an awful feeling about this
-- Lorne: "Could the Octarians have something to do with this?"
-- Marie: "Naww, if they did they would have gone for the Zapfish too"
-- Callie: "Maybe Gramps has heard something?"
-- The three head up to Inkopolis Plaza to Octo Valley and Craig's outpost

- 06 - ???
-- The three arrive in Octo Valley - Agent 4's never been there before
-- Callie explains the situation and asks Craig if he's seen or heard Lily about since Friday
-- Not personally, but he can maybe check the radio tapes
-- Since last year he has setup one of the team's radios hooked up to a tape recorder, and reels of audio tape to listen through
-- He rewinds through the tape and they hear Lily's incredibly brief transmission
-- *beep beep beep beep beep* "Cra--oof--" *silence*
-- That was definitely Lily's voice, where was she?

-- Her clothes were washed overnight
-- DJ Octavio makes an address to the public on the steps of the palace about his return, and Lily's presence in the HQ
-- Lily's day underground, watched by the Octarians and restricted to the grounds of Cephalon HQ
-- Octavio's instructed Ceph Squad to watch over her, and Lux and Renki are the only ones that can speak Inklish, hence can talk to Lily
-- There are rumors going about that Lily and Octavio mated (they did), because guards outside the door had heard them at it
--- And of course, Lily is mortified, but the Octarians are more concerned that Octavio chose an *inkling*? Really, King?
-- Later that day, Octavio summons her to have her new hypnoshades put on, which pacifies her but doesn't otherwise take effect
-- She is taken to the studio of Arthra Pedy, unconscious, and Arthra recalibrates the glasses (they were configured for a standard inkling brain)
-- When Lily finally awakens, her mind under the control of the shades, DJ Octavio tells her of her first mission
