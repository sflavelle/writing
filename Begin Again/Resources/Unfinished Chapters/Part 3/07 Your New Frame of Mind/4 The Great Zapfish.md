The Square was empty as Lily climbed up through the grate.

Its lights and billboards still shone brightly, but as Lily adjusted her glasses, it seemed that nobody at all was around.

She walked around the Square briefly, eyeing the scene from different angles. The only activity she could hear or see appeared to be her own.

And, glancing up at the Deca Tower, she saw the Great Zapfish, curled up around its upper levels.

Her lips curled into a smile. *Good.*

Though she noted a single lit window above the Ammo Knights storefront. The shop itself was unlit. She wondered if Sheldon, the shop owner, had simply forgotten to turn off the light.

In any case, she was satisfied. She walked back to the grate and, facing the Square, stomped her right foot on it three times, the muffled sound of rubber sole on dense metal making a quiet ring.

After stepping away, she heard the noise of four cephalopods jumping and reforming into Octoling form - Ceph Squad had joined her.

"Welcome to the heart of Inkopolis, girls," Lily said with a smirk.

They fanned out, looking around at the awesome sight around them. Most of the girls had not seen sights like this for a long time.

"Are you sure you're ready to do this?" Lux asked of the inkling, hanging back as they both looked upward toward their quarry.

Lily simply nodded. "I must. Anything to help the Octarians."

Lux smirked. She seemed impressed with the effect of these special glasses on her. Like Callie, the hypnoshades didn't seem to drastically alter Lily's personality - it simply tweaked her allegiances. And though the King had apparently built in a way to enforce his will upon her, as she had seen back home, it hadn't had much adverse effect upon her.

Though, in this bright light, she noted an odd bump forming in the ends of her tentacles...

"This place is amazing!" Renki said softly, staring up at the scenery around them.

"Wouldn't it be nice to live up here?" Kae wondered.

"Once the King owns this city, I'm sure we could." Lux smirked. "Mori, Kae, Renki, assemble the device. Lily and I will start planning our climb."

"That light's just turned off," Mori said, nodding toward the Ammo Knights upstairs window.

Lily and the Squad glanced toward it, then toward Lily, who was frowning. Lux watched her expectantly. "Lily, is that bad?" the squad leader asked.

"Probably. I think the owner's done here and is about to come out. He's going home."

"You know them?"

"Yeah."

"Right. You meet him out here. Lure him out toward the tower and we'll take him out." Lux backed away, toward the grate.

As the others moved out of the line of sight of the doorway, Lux dropped back behind the side of the shopfront, and Lily swivelled around to face the tower, staring upward.

Staring up at the sleeping Great Zapfish.

The square was quiet for a few moments. Just the gentle white noise of the occasional car driving down the nearby thoroughfare.

Then Lily heard the sound of an automatic sliding door opening to her left and footsteps on concrete.

The creature exiting into the Square stopped quite suddenly upon seeing her straight ahead. She heard a sharp gasp, and then nothing, for a second or two.

"Lily...?"

Lily said nothing.

She heard the click of a lock as Sheldon locked the shopfront once more, and slowly walked up to her, confused. "Lily, what are you doing out here so late...?"

"I could say the same for you," she finally said, turning away.

"Y'know your friends haven't seen you all day, right? Where've you been?"

She didn't answer for a few seconds.

"Lily? Are you okay...?"

She took a deep breath. "I've been thinking, Sheldon. About everything."

"Please look at me, Lily." She felt Sheldon's hand brush against her arm, and she pulled away. "You're worrying me."

After another deep breath, she slowly turned to face him, giving a slow nod to Lux, hidden in a shadow behind him.

Sheldon saw the shades, the red glowing dot over her left eye. Something was unsettling him about Lily. He searched his memory while Lily spoke.

"I mean, look. There's a concept among humans of 'survival of the fittest'. The healthiest, fittest, smartest, whateverest, survive and pass on their DNA to the future. And yet, the war was won on sheer luck."

"That's... a gross oversimplification, Lily," Sheldon replied with a frown, still trying to remember what was concerning him. "My granddad fought in that war, so I *know* there was more to it than that."

"Well even so." Lily frowned, her face otherwise betraying no emotion. "That you and our other supposed 'friends' and I would go through so much together, only for you all to stab me in the back? Having *Agent 4* do the dirty work of 'disposing of the human'?" Her breath hitched, and she paused for a moment as Sheldon mouthed 'what the fuck' silently to himself. "...I wonder if you lot just can't help yourself."

"Lily, what on *Earth* are you talking about? None of us did a *thing*, we *all* still care about you."

"...Heh. Whatever makes you happy."

The inkling's frown became a smirk, giving her an ominous look. "But I *know*. After what my 'friends' tried to do to me, I have no choice but to retaliate."

Sheldon gulped, and turned to run back toward the store.

Only to immediately run into Kae and Lux, who had silently moved behind him. They quickly got him onto the ground as Mori walked over, having pulled a garbage bag from one of the bins at the far end of the Square. Lily smirked as she saw it. "I like it. Tie him up in that."

It finally sunk in for the crab as the Octolings loomed over him, Lily approaching. *Those glasses. They brainwash Octarians! But-- Then Lily--*

She knelt down in front of Sheldon, whose eyes went wide. "Let this be a warning for the lot of you: *your time is over*."

Then, taking the weapon-like device Renki handed to her, she smacked the butt of the device firmly into Sheldon's head, which knocked him out. His body slumped to the ground.

As Kae and Mori stuck the bag on him, Lux looked up toward Lily. "Not bad, if a bit dramatic."

Lily paused, looking at Sheldon for just a moment longer, then she finally released the breath she had been holding, and cocked her head to one side as she looked toward the squad leader. "I admit I have a flair for playing up the evil and dramatic." She stood and, turning away from the squad and from Sheldon's body, taking a proper hold of the device. "But that's not what we came here to do."

"No, it's not. Are you ready, Lily?" Lux asked as she joined her at the foot of the Tower once again.

"I'm ready."

"Good. Team, defensive positions around this tower once the creature is dealt with. Lily and I will execute the mission objective now."

The two of them looked at each other, then took hold of the structure on either side.

"Let's climb."
