CQ was roused from his thoughts as the scenery out the window changed.

The train was passing through the old Deepsea Metro Central Station.

The sight of the shattered glass that *still* littered the station platform...

It brought him back again. To when the lie was exposed to him.

A year ago, he had watched from the door of the train as Subject 10,008, his friend and the telephone had excitedly assembled the Four Thangs, desperate to return to the surface.

And saw the spinning blades activate inside the machine as the telephone had ushered them both in. The two creatures were slowly raised toward them, their impending death.

Because they had bested the telephone's challenge.

If not for a then-unknown warrior who came to save them, who he would soon come to know as 'Agent 3', their fate would have been assured.

Subject 10,008 had taken the opportunity to escape. And as he continued to watch Craig Cuttlefish watch over Agent 3's unconscious form, unable to help them, a strange slime had begun to ooze from the telephone's frame and latch itself onto Agent 3. The creature suddenly stirred, taking Craig by surprise, capturing him and also vanishing upward.

Shortly after that, the power had gone out in the Metro. And everything that had depended on it - the lights, CQ Stations, test obstacles, and even the distortion that had given the telephone's Metro its distinct look - had switched off or become inoperable.

The tests no longer seemed to exist - replaced with boring corridors and rooms in the vague layout of the tests. The moving targets the telephone had modelled after various octopus creatures were nowhere to be found. And even if the stations worked - the card terminals at each station wouldn't, without power.

Testing had stopped, completely.

And though soon after Craig had returned, vowing to protect the Metro with his proteg√© Agent 3, nothing seemed to happen after that. The train would travel through the Metro, the two watching over the Stations and the people, and ensure that no harm would come to them.

But soon Craig and Agent 3 too left, on their own business - and CQ Cumber was left to figure out his future, and the Metro's future.

And so too, did CQ opt to escape. Finally directing the train out of the area he had come to know as the testing track.

CQ Cumber sighed and looked away from the windows. "I can't keep doing this to myself," he finally said as he carefully hopped down onto the ground.
