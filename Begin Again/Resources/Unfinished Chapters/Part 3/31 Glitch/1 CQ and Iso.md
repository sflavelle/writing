## Glitch

The doors closed and the train pulled away from the station.

Inside the passengers were strange creatures that no surface-dwelling creature had ever seen before. They were all headed to their jobs, their homes, or somewhere in between.

"Please have your tickets or travel cards ready, everyone."

As the travellers embarking took their seats, a small bioluminescent slug began to shuffle its way down the aisle, extending his tendrils to take and check the various tickets against his multi-purpose device. Each would light up a green indicator, and he would hand the ticket back to its owner.

Being a sea cucumber, this would take some time as he worked his way from the front of the train toward the back. But C.Q. Cumber was *the* sea cucumber for the job. Otherwise efficient, friendly, and knowledgeable, and even a former hardware engineer, he had begun working for the Deepsea Metro System Authority three months after his previous conductor work had... rather suddenly ceased.

Once the checks on the passengers that had just boarded were complete, and since he had reached the back of the train already, CQ made his way toward a rather tall isopod that always hung in the back corner, in the last carriage, opposite the door - a comforting familiar face that had followed him from their old life. "Comfortable, Mr. Padre?" CQ asked in his small, high-pitched voice.

"Quite so." Iso Padre smiled down at his compatriot. "And I hope you are taking care of yourself as well, my friend."

"Of course." CQ Cumber wriggled up the bench leg to seat himself by his friend. "I must say, I cannot believe you are still here by my side. We have the entire Deepsea Metro open to us now, and yet you choose to stay on these trains."

Iso nodded. "These trains are my home now, friend. If I'd not failed my testing, perhaps it would be a different story. But alas. I have nowhere else to go. I would rather stay somewhere familiar."

"I am aware." CQ watched out of the opposite window as the endless brick walls and dim lighting passed by. He checked the map on his CQ80 device. "Well, we are nearing that part of the route again... allow me to inform the passengers."

He toggled on a switch on the device, and then began to speak into it. His voice was broadcasted on the speakers throughout the train. "Attention everyone. We will shortly be passing into the Kamabo Co Testing Track 'A' Line. This track is entirely unpowered and there will be a brief outage of a few seconds as we switch to battery power to continue our journey. For your safety, please make sure you are in your seats. Thank you."
