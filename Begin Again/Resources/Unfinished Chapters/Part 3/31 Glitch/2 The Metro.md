Kamabo Co...

CQ Cumber and Iso Padre both knew it well, unfortunately.

An underground network of tracks and stations that had been siezed by an entity he had simply known as 'the telephone' - that he had been trapped in and eventually was coaxed into working for, over a hundred years ago - an alliance under the name of 'Kamabo Co'.

Back then he had been told he was aiding in the cause of science. That those who could best the challenge set by the telephone - to find four items it had placed throughout the Kamabo Co Metro track - would be rewarded by access to the surface world.

The surface - a place far above, a supposed paradise, untouched by creatures such as he.

And all that time he had believed it - seeing test subject after test subject appear to take on the challenges at each station the telephone had co-opted. Most of the subjects were creatures called Octolings - strange octopus-like creatues that he was told lived under the ground. Some were Deepsea creatures like himself that had managed to wander in.

Every test subject had failed at some point in their journey - running out of credits or energy or will before reaching any of the four 'Thangs'. Few chose to stay - like Iso Padre, who had lost his memory from the ordeal, no longer knowing a life before the Metro, and elected to stay to encourage other test subjects. Most simply vanished, never to be seen again.

All had failed...

All but one.

Subject 10,008, an octoling male, was the first to not only collect a single 'Thang', but to collect *all* of the Thangs. He had been accompanied by another strange but similar-looking creature, by the name of Craig Cuttlefish, who couldn't participate in the tests, but seemed to be there to encourage the test subject.

CQ Cumber remembered his excitement, watching them conquer every test set before them, if not the first time then eventually.

He also remembered how chatty and interested in the Deepsea system Craig had been - how he had often caught him and Iso in discussion over various topics, including the surface world, from which he had apparently hailed.

CQ's train of thought was cut off by the lights in the train suddenly switching off - they had crossed the barrier into the testing track. After a few moments, as the train coasted along, its battery backup kicked in, and the lights flickered back to life. The train ramped back up to its original speed.

The scenery on the other side of the windows did not change, aside from the light fading away behind them.

"Every time..." CQ murmured to himself.

The subway train ventured forward into the darkness.
