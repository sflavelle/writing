"...and I'll be doing what I can to make the Shifty Stations from the Splatfest season available in some capacity," Marina said confidently. "I had a great time building them for you all, and I... kinda hope to see them used again, get fresh life breathed into them."

"As you should, yo," Pearl nodded with a grin. "You did a fantastic job with them all." She turned her chair around to the crowd that had gathered outside the studio window. "Didn't she, folks?!"

The crowd of inklings, octolings and jellies whooped and hollered. They were here to celebrate Off the Hook and the concluded Splatfest season. But they were also here for a sad occasion.

This was the last Inkopolis News broadcast Off the Hook would host.

"Yeah, that's what I like to hear!" Pearl grinned and waved, then turned back to the studio camera. "So look forward to more news about that!"

"That's right! Please stay tuned." Marina smiled to the camera, then looked briefly at their teleprompter.

They'd run out of scripted news. This was it.

Marina began to gently fade out the news backing music through her mixer, taking a deep breath.

"Wow, really? It's time?" Pearl's eyes widened, and took a look at the prompter as well.

Marina nodded. "Mmhmm. It's time." With one final record scratch and synth 'hit', the image on the screen between Pearl and Marina became the Off the Hook logo. The music was now completely gone. As she stepped out from behind the mixing console, and Pearl slid out from her chair, Marina began to speak to the camera. "Everyone, I... apologise in advance. The next few minutes are going to be *real* emotional and sappy. I know you've probably had your fill of that from that last Splatfest, the final one of the season... But, we didn't want to just end our last broadcast without a proper send-off and... a few parting words."

"I'm gonna leave this to 'Rina, folks." Pearl smiled her trademark toothy grin. "I've got some comments, and a few words of my own at the end, but, she's been planning this speech for quite a while."

"Thanks, Pearlie. It's true, I've been thinking about how I would farewell this gig for... quite a while." Marina took a deep breath. "So I suppose I'll start..." She sighed. "...with a confession. One that I suppose many people would have seen coming at some point."

She paused, hands clasped in front of her. She'd written this into her speech - she'd decided, now that she'd weathered the initial speculations that she was comfortable coming out and saying it. But now that she was about to do it, her nerves had flared up. She took a few moments to compose herself. "I... Like many of the people that have been arriving into Inkopolis over the past year, I... I am not an inkling. We are... We... have dubbed ourselves 'octolings'. "

She took a deep breath. *Okay. She'd said it. The rest would come easier.* "The name will carry some meaning to our... elderly audience. I suspect many of our younger Turf War players out here today may not quite understand why. When I came to Inkopolis some time ago, it was... it was to seek a better life. I was tired of a society that promoted war, *actual war*, atop everything else. I was tired of... not having a life of my own.

"I mention this because I was... motivated to leave it all behind and become a better person, the person I am today. Inspired by two people, that I never thought I would have the arduous task of filling their shoes... Callie and Marie. The Squid Sisters. When Inkopolis News approached the two of us to be the new hosts, to succeed them, I... didn't think I'd still be here, two years later, with all of you cheering us on throughout. I didn't think that I'd have performed alongside the Squid Sisters. *Several* times. I didn't think I'd get to witness *history* being made in my lifetime, with these discoveries about humans *still* happening."

She took another breath, a moment to calm herself. "But, anyway... Just because we're wrapping up the news here, doesn't mean this is the last you'll see of either of us. Or *both* of us. There's always another show, always another album, always another guest spot."

"Always another Salmon Run shift, always another turf war," Pearl finished. "Y'all, we're not goin' away! This ain't some 'twice as bright, half as long' nonsense! We're only gonna keep growin', so keep showin'!" She let herself smile. "For reals though, I don't have a story to tell like Marina, but, thank y'all for helping us make this some of the happiest time of our lives."

Marina nodded. "Yes, from the very bottom of our hearts... *thank you*, Inkopolis, for accepting us, supporting us, bringing us into your lives, and being a part of ours."

Pearl's smile became a full-on grin. "And hey, make sure that the love you've all shared with us goes to the new hosts as well. You'll love 'em. Pearl seal of approval right there." She jokingly threw out a thumbs-up.

Marina let out a giggle, before settling down and mentally running through her list of things to say. "And... I think that's everything." She bowed deeply, and Pearl did the same. "So, for the last time from us at Inkopolis News..."

And, as rote, Pearl and Marina did their signature poses. They chimed together as one, "Don't get cooked, stay off the hook."

"Thanks for the ride, everyone," Marina said with a sad smile.

As soon as the broadcast cut off, the crowd of people burst into applause and cheering, as did the crew in the studio with them. Once again, both girls bowed, first to the news crew, then turning around and bowing and waving to the crowd outside the window.
