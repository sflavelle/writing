"Hey, whoa."

"Mmm?" Marina looked over, taking her attention away from the Square for a moment. It was a slow news day at Inkopolis News, so Pearl and Marina had plenty of time today to chill and follow social media.

"'Ja know that Lily's been DJing small-time clubs lately?" Pearl showed her her phone, and Marina could see a social media post someone had made, with an attached video from the crowd showing Lily playing some music. "Because I sure knew nothing about this."

She seemed to have a mixer and a laptop she was using to perform, and LED screens and light strips pulsed in time to a beat. The crowd seemed to be having a good time, but Lily seemed a little more focused on DJing.

"No, I didn't!" Marina responded, watching the clip on Pearl's phone. "That's so cool though! I'm glad she ended up chasing her dream. She looks like she's having a good time."

"Yeaaaah, *but*, just one thing, 'Rina: she didn't tell us? Ya squiddin' me?" Pearl looked somewhat miffed. "And look at her, she's just standing there twiddling knobs and stickin' her arms up. The music's good n' all, but she's not *performing*."

"So? She's new to the game." Marina leaned back into her chair, turning her watch back to the Square. "Give her time."

"Nuh uh. This shall not stand." She began to tap away at the device.

The Octoling turned to look at her. "Uhh, dare I ask...?"

"I'm looking her up," she replied, mumbling slightly. "Gonna see when and where she's performing next. I wanna watch her do her thing, and see if I need to teach her a thing or two."

"About... DJing? Pearl, no offense---"

"About *working the crowd*, 'Rina! Anyone can spin some plates or hit play on a computer. I dunno what exactly she's doing there, but she's certainly not hyping up the crowd, no 'GIVE IT UP FOR SONG NUMBER TWELVE' or whatever. She's got no stage persona." Pearl made a few small noises as she finished her phone query. "Hm, guess she's playing Saturday nights at some small club in Inkopolis West. I think I'll pay her a visit then and give some tips. You in?"

Marina thought it over. "I mean, I'll wanna watch her perform too, but I think she's doing fine. She'll grow into it, Pearlie."

"Maybe..." Pearl raised an eyebrow at her partner. "I thought you'd be happy that I'd try to do something with her."
