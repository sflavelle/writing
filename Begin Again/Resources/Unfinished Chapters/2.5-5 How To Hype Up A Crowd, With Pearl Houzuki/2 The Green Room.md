Lily opened the door to the green room backstage, a small area with soft couches surrounding a simple wooden table. Since nobody else was here, she let herself flop onto one of the longer couches, taking a few deep breaths and resting her eyes for just a few moments.

*That was fun,* she thought to herself.

"Hey."

Lily's eyes snapped open.

Pearl was standing just behind the arm of the couch, arms crossed with a smirk.

Lily let off a deep sigh. "...Hello Pearl. And to what do I owe this pleasure?"

"Finally caught wind of these lil' shows you've been doing. *Finally.*" The idol relaxed a bit, sitting herself on the couch arm next to Lily's head. "And I just thought I'd be nice and come watch!"

Lily raised an eyebrow. Pearl *had* become nicer to her over the months, after the rocky start to their friendship, but the two had never hung out enough for Lily to really get over it. She internally debated how to respond. "I'm glad you came out to see me," she replied after a few moments, sitting up on the couch and turning to face Pearl.

"I did have some feedback, though."

"Oh." Lily's expression dropped. "Pearl, you're not a DJ, are you?"

"Nope." Pearl shook her head, but smiled. "Look, that part, I got no issue with. You're doin' fine." She slid off the arm of the couch onto the plush cushions next to Lily, crossing one leg over the other. "Marina loved it. She reckons you've got a good niche going on there."

"Thats nice of her..."

"Right? I mean, I've seen plenty of other DJs look up to her. I guess she's got a pretty great rep to them." Pearl turned slightly, resting her arm on the back of the couch as she talked. "Anyway, look. Y'know how during our shows, I'm usually the one talkin' to the crowd? Y'know, sometimes we introduce songs, or hype people up for the chorus, that sorta thing?"

"Right...?"

"One thing I noticed during your show is you weren't doin' any of that. In fact I think besides... what, the beginning and the end - oh, and that one song you called out, what was it, 'Sandstorm'? - you weren't really communicating with the crowd."

"You're the MC, Pearl. I'm just the DJ working on my own here." Lily crossed her arms. "You can't expect me to do all that work too?"

"I mean, I do," Pearl conceded. "But that's just because I wanna see you be your best. But that's not the point. The *crowd* is gonna expect that. They're not just here for the music."

"They're not?" The inkling was slightly taken aback. "Isn't that novelty the whole reason they're coming out?"

"Sure, for right now. But, Lil', you *want* them to keep comin' out, to see *you* perform. To see *you* play those tracks the way *you* do. Otherwise they'd just go online and download that archive some rando we *definitely don't know* put up." Pearl smirked in Lily's direction. "Don't think I can't put two and two together. But it's a part of the job. The people need a personality. Someone who's as excited about the music as they are. Who knows what they're playing, and can get the crowd hyped. Even if it's just counting down a drop. Just give 'em *something.*"

"...OK, I guess I get what you're saying..." Lily sighed, and nodded, thinking. "I'll try to remember to incorporate more of that at the next show."

"You're self-taught, aren't you?"

"Well yeah."

"OK.
