Sheldon's back offices were, to put it nicely, untidy. Each room seemed like it served a wildly different purpose. The room Lily was ultimately steered into was supposedly supposed to serve a medical purpose - there was a kind of dentist's chair near the middle and various equipment around it. It was like the messy version of a TV studio's picture of a doctor's office. "Take a seat, please miss," Sheldon said, gesturing at Lily toward the chair.

As she made herself comfortable, Agent 4 sat on the medical bed behind the chair, and Sheldon sat by the chair, getting protective gear on. As he did so, he finally asked Lily to talk about herself. She had to think about this, wondering how much to tell. She chose her words carefully. "So I'm... I'm basically a big computer nerd," she began, staring up at the ceiling as she talked. "I lived for about... 26 years on..." She paused, unsure whether she was in another universe or something, or from the past. "Sorry, 26 years before I got... turned, I guess. Worked in cleaning, did some factory work. I guess most people in my life would call me a good friend, that I was there for them..."

"Good, good," Sheldon said absentmindedly. "How did you come to arrive in Octo Canyon, then? Do you remember?"

Lily could feel Agent 4 leaning closer behind her. "I... remember, but I can't make sense of it. My part of the world isn't really supposed to get earthquakes or things like that, but that's more or less what happened. This ravine opened up under my house and I just kinda got... thrown in. I thought for sure I was just dead. I guess I blacked out or something, but right before that the darkness of that ravine just sorta turned into bright light and... I guess that might have been when I 'arrived' here. But stuff like that isn't supposed to happen where I come from..."

"It doesn't happen here either," Agent 4 chimed in. "Sounds like magic."

"Don't confuse the poor girl," Sheldon admonished her. "Magic doesn't exist here either, only in fiction." He turned back to Lily, having now put on more appropriate doctor wear on top of his regular outfit and holding a small needle. "Hold still a moment, I'm taking a DNA sample. So tell me, are you... alright? I can't imagine many people would be able to cope with what you're going through, with the loss of your... identity, I guess."

"You mean I'm not a boy anymore, don't you? Ow." Lily winced as the needle carefully entered her arm.

"Well, all of it, but... start with that if you want."

"I miss it a little bit, if that's what you mean," Lily said, unimpressed. "As a whole, I've the same general body structure, so while yeah this all feels weird it's not like I'm entirely out of my element. Most of the shock feels more from the fact this world feels so much the same but at the same so different to mine, and also y'know, I was friggin' attacked last night. I'm more upset about that than losing my male identity. Actually, also kind of in shock about losing access to my phone and my friends. May as well be the same thing, was never great at making local friends."

"Interesting that you mention that." Sheldon had transferred the sample to a small test tube, and put it aside in a fridge, and was now removing the doctor gear. "Okay, Miss Lily, that's the sample done. I'll let you know the results soon. Now let's get you both out to the firing range where I have a few more things for you."
