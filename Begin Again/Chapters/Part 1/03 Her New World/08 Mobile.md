When they left it was about 2PM, and the Square was a bit quieter. "...But really, the best way to practice is to get into the Turf Wars," Agent 4 was saying as they left. "It's all above board and designed so you can't really get hurt... maybe you just hurt your pride a little."

"I'll manage," Lily smiled. "So where next?" 

"Oh! I don't actually know..." said the orange-tentacled inkling, thinking. "Well, you've got your mobile back, but we should probably hook you up with something more proper if you're gonna be sticking around. I know a provider a short ways away we can get a good price on."

"That'd be cool, but, I dunno. I don't exactly have cash to get on a plan with."

"Look, don't worry about that," came the reply, Agent 4 grinning at her. "I'll cover ya today. We're only going pre-paid anyway, and I've been doing fine on the turf wars on my spare time so trust me, I can afford to do this."

Lily let her mouth hang silently. These creatures were treating her so nicely, she thought. It felt like Agent 4 had brought her into the fold a lot more readily than she expected, and that surprised her. She knew though that they would have to part ways for a while for their respective missions, and it would most likely be her on her own...

"...You okay, Lil? You're tearing up." Agent 4 was staring at her, and she couldn't help but blush. "It's not that big of a deal..."

"Oh gosh, it is for /me/, though," Lily quietly said. "Phones are really expensive in my time, and I've never heard of anyone doing anything like that for me..."

"Yeah? Well, maybe they should." 

"But..."

"Come on." Agent 4 took her by the hand and began dragging her along. She quickly gave up and started walking behind her, but Agent 4 never let go. She had a tight grip, but it was also... warm. And soft. She quickly pushed her thoughts to the side - this was really the wrong time to think too hard on that, she flimsily justified to herself.
