And just like that, Lily found herself inside a shop called "Ammo Knights". The shop was indeed dedicated to displays of different types of weaponry. She did a double take when she saw a simple metal bucket hanging off the wall. *I mean, I GUESS*, Lily screamed in her head.

According to Agent 4, they were all for handling ink in some capacity. "See, turf wars thrive with all the different strategies all these offer."

"Turf wars? Is that... common in this city?"

"All the time! It's an Inkling's most popular pastime!"

Lily blinked. "I.. guess I must be thinking of something else."

"Ahh, welcome, Agent!" A friendly male voice called from the back of the shop as a short fellow, slightly yellow all over, scurried out from behind the counter to meet them. He shook Agent 4's hand and then turned to bow to Lily. "And you must be our special guest from the past! Welcome to our humble city!"

Lily shifted about, uncomfortable. "I uh, appreciate the gesture, Sheldon, but I'm not that special anymore." Regardless, she reached out her hand to shake his.

"Pah! Always a pleasure." Sheldon's smile seemed at least genuine. "Miss Marie has kept me up to date on your situation, and if I may I'd like to perform a few tests if I could be so bold...?"

She looked at him, then at Agent 4. "I'm... assuming all this is staying confidential, right?"

"Of course," Sheldon said with another smile and a bow. "For the time being, of course. I've not seen any cases of someone being changed by ink contact before, and I'm hoping to figure out why this has happened."

He shifted his gaze toward the back door. "But also, if it would put you at ease, I have retrieved something that might belong to you."

"Well..." Lily thought briefly about it. There wasn't much she felt she could do to object, and her trust in Marie hadn't felt particularly misplaced yet, so she nodded. "Lead the way."  

"Excellent! It was also recommended to me that we give you some time on the shooting range when we are finished. I assume you could help her there, Agent 4?"

"Of course."

"Splendid! Now, please follow me through the back."
