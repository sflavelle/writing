## Her New World

"Is... this normal?"

"No, she's just weird."

Lily stood awkwardly as Agent 4 continued to walk around her, an orange-tentacled inkling to Lily's sky-blue, examining her from seemingly every angle. Marie, standing two meters away, had just introduced the two.

She was glad that she'd been given this level 1 clothing - though she'd slept in, the late morning air was still a bit chilly. The clothes fit snugly on her - though she figured that was more due to the material than her size - and they hugged her form.

Apparently defeated in trying to find a flaw in Lily's 'disguise', Agent 4 straightened up and crossed her arms, putting on some mocking voice. "So! Where'd ya come from, hooooman?  Gonna take over again, hoooooman? Where'd you learn to fight a squad of Octos, hoooooooman? Eh?"

Lily stared at her. She was still working out where the relation of her world, or time, to theirs was. "Uhhhhh... Earth? No? I didn't? I was terrible?"

Marie interjected, a slight smirk on her face. "She's only still here because I don't think they expected someone to fight them without clothes." 

Lily sighed and rolled her eyes. "Give me a break! If I took the extra minute to put this stuff on I wouldn't be here."

"I know, I know. I am at least glad that you held your own long enough for me to get there..." There was a slight pause, and Agent 4 settled back into her usual self. "Well, Agent 4, I figured, since you missed the action last night, would you show her around, help her settle in?

"Sounds great! Hooray, I have a new friend\~!" Agent 4 said in a sing songy voice, and grabbed Lily's hand, pulling her along toward the grate which led toward the Inkopolis Square. "Come on! Race you to the square!" She jumped into the air, transformed into a squid, and slid neatly past the grate cover, and vanished into the ink below.

Lily stood above the grate, staring down after her, a frown forming. About ten seconds later, the same orange squid reappeared underneath the grate and stared up at her.

"Oh right..." She thought she heard it say.
