"Oh! Speaking of!" Sheldon said excitedly, shuffling over to a corner and retrieving what looked like some more weapons from the table and bringing them over to Lily.  "The ink tank,   
Splat Bombs, and Ink Armor mechanism to accompany your Splattershot Jr, seeing you'll be able to use them now."

"Oh, uh... thanks," said the inkling girl awkwardly. "Is this supposed to be free, or..?"

"Well, no. See, at Ammo Knights we sell each weapon as a complete set. So every weapon you saw in the shopfront will always come with an inksplosive grenade or projectile of some kind, and what we call a 'special' weapon for Turf Wars, which is limited use but can turn the tide when used well. The sets basically cater to different play styles, so once you reach level 4 in the Turf Wars and you feel like your current set just isn't cutting it, maybe take a look at the other sets available! We always recommend sticking with the Splattershot for a while though, it's an all-rounder. These things are what come with it."

Lily nodded. So this turf war thing is more like a sport and not so much to do with actual gangs... got it. "And this canister?"

"Oh, well, that's what holds your ink! It's what makes your set work together! Quite literally, actually," he permitted himself a small chuckle. "When you go into your squid form and sit around in your ink, or your team's ink, the tank will fill up, making sure you're ready to get back into the fray in seconds. And then it comes with nozzles to connect to your weapons and projectiles, to make sure they're ready to use when you need them!"

"And... I think that's it! Oh, no, actually..." He ran off to the table again and grabbed a strange handheld device, bringing it over and placing it in Lily's free hand, with a data cable wrapped around it. "I've been working on a translator at Miss Marie's request, human to inkling and back. I'd much appreciate it if you could supply some more sample data for me."

Lily examined it. It was a yellow, oddly-shaped device, some cross between a Yak Bak and a Digivice, with a plug that matched the connector for the iPhone she was continuing to hold in the other hand. The cable was, amazingly enough, seemingly designed to plug into both devices. "We managed to collaborate with the tech company behind this building to reverse-engineer the connection for your phone, so you should be able to record your voice and import that or any other voice recordings you may have on to this device, which'll then be sent wirelessly to me. I mean, hey, if you are able to provide some of your own translations of things, that would be greatly appreciated, but there are certainly more important things at hand here..."

Lily nodded. "I at least know that I have some spoken podcasts... ah, audio shows on my phone that I can plug into it..."

Sheldon smiled. His work was done. "Well, that's basically everything I can think of. Any questions before we get you out on the firing range?"
