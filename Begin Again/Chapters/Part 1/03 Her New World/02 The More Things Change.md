"Come on, say it!"

"It's not THAT weird..."

"But look at all the tall buildings!"

"We had those!"

"There's screens everywhere!"

"Times Square was a thing..."

"We've got creatures with fur, though!" Agent 4 gestured wildly at Judd snoozing by the entrance to the Battle Lobby.

"Cats existed where I came from!"

"Whoooooaaa. Judd's oooold."

"I mean, I don't think I've ever seen that cat before..."

Lily and Agent 4 sat at a table off to the side of the square, eating soft-serve ice cream cones. They'd just spent some time walking around the different storefronts, Agent 4 giving her the guided tour. 

*As it turned out*, Lily thought, *I guess it's really difficult to describe how to do something that's naturally inherent in your species*. It had taken a few tries, and lots of awkward explaining, but they eventually managed to get Lily into a squid form so they could both travel to Inkopolis. 

Going from the quiet, floating platforms in Octo Canyon to a bustling city was a shock to Lily, but she realised pretty quickly that things hadn't changed much from the cities she'd been to. She watched the populace move by as she finished her ice cream, watching them go about their daily life. Groups of Inklings hanging out with each other. Some just slowly plodding by in front of their phones. She stared out into the crowd until Agent 4 nudged her to get her attention. "Mmm?"

"Shouldn't we go see Sheldon now?"

"Who?"

"The guy who runs the weapons shop! Mar-- Our friend said you should get a checkup done, to see what was going on with you."

"Aaaaand the weapons shopkeeper can do that."

"Just going off of what I was told! Let's go!"
