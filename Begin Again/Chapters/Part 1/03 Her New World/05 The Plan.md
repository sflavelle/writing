The firing range was a rented warehouse behind the buildings of the Square, mostly concreted and with railings, walkways and tracks installed for various inflatable targets. It was a place for Inklings old and new to try out the latest weapons, or just the ones they are interested in. Sheldon led the two squids to the back of his shop, which looked out into the range, in which was a map of what seemed like the main region of the country in which Inkopolis and Octopia both resided, as well as several tables full of various things. There were several areas circled on the map, some close, some far, but what they meant was not immediately apparent.

"When you appeared in our world," Sheldon began again, "you did not come through alone. Several items - by the sounds of things, some of your belongings - came through the supposed portal and scattered throughout our land. I've no idea what condition they may be in, but there are three that were found here in this city, four more within Octo Canyon, one outside of the city limits somewhere, and one more in the waters where a company called Grizzco operates, so you'll more than likely have to go with them to get close to that one."

"H-how do you know all this already?"

"I hear things here and there. I'm privy to some breaking news. These two in the city, for example," Sheldon gestured at two points on the outer edges of the city, "were discovered almost right away I believe, but they're on our skyscrapers. These particular ones, there's no roof access and they were designed so you can't ink and swim up them. It's a building code of some sort," he said. "These," he gestured at Octo Canyon, "were picked up by Marie over sonar. No idea what they are, just that they have the same sort of 'otherworldly scent'."

Lily nodded. A plan was beginning to form. It was probably a stupid plan, but it was something. "OK, so where you do you recommend I get started?"

"With this." And Sheldon handed her a mobile phone.

"Err, thanks." She glanced over it, and then made to put it in her shorts pocket, but it twigged and she gave it another look. "No fucking way..." she thought, a bit loudly.

Sheldon had just given her her iPhone.

Her eyes lit up as she held the power button to turn it on. While it booted, she looked at him and Agent 4, beaming. "My goodness, you guys! I was starting to think you were just pulling my leg! It's... entirely undamaged too, what the hell."

"Now, there's no real time limit to getting these," Sheldon said, getting her back on topic, "but be aware that especially in the Canyon, you may have enemy parties looking for or defending them, so... if you decide to go for those, maybe go for them first."

"Maybe I can help with at least scouting the Canyon locations," said Agent 4, looking closer at the map. "These two locations nearest home I must have already been to, and I can give you an idea of what you'll face later on. Same with the others but who knows, you may end up beating me there, since I'm grabbing Zapfishes as well." 

"Alright, well, let's see..." Lily thought about it for a moment. "Okay, so why don't we coordinate on the Canyon ones, grab a couple out there first, and then I could... maybe grab one or both of the city ones, outskirts, then see how we are by then? I figure, the 'Octos' as you call them probably know about some of these, and probably have one or two already, so it might be worth me doing what I can to get some experience in the field before I take them on more directly..."
