After the phone store, they also went to the Shellendorf Institute Museum - it was open for visitors on the weekdays, and Agent 4 took her to the human exhibit and they talked about her world. Lily would later remember standing in front of the human skeleton recovered from fossils and being amazed at how much shorter she was now. The exhibit also displayed some technology of the time - apparently recovered from various known ruin sites. Lily also decided she would visit those sites someday.

The museum also showed plenty of the history of Inklings and other prominent species in the city, and she read everything that she could, fascinated.

It was about 4PM when they finally made their way back to the grate that would take them back to the Tentakeel Hideout. "Look, seriously, thanks for showing me around," Lily said. "It's scary being a fish out of water here, but I feel like I'm gonna be at least mostly okay if I end up living here. Thanks. It means a whole lot, what you did today."

Agent 4 blushed. "It's been an honor to introduce someone new to my world, and a real human at that. I um... I hope that you stick around. You seem pretty cool."

They both slipped through the drain and made their way back.
