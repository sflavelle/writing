## The Longest Night

Most of the rest of that day was spent back at Agent 4's apartment, making mashups and looking through what was on television. Lily had found that there was indeed a 'sports' channel, and while trying to make a Madeon song work with a song she had found through her squid phone's internet, she'd glance over at the TV screen at the replay of some earlier match, or talk show, or league game.

From this, she learned a few things. For one, Turf War was not the only sanctioned sport enjoyed with ink-based weaponry. Though the most common, there were more competitive sports that enjoyed more coverage, at least on the channel she was watching.

The other thing she learned is that this squid song really worked with the Madeon beat. She saved the sketch and made a note to herself to work on it more some other time.
