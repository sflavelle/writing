"You seated back there, Agent 4?" Sheldon called from the driver's seat. Marie and Callie, her cousin, were putting on their seatbelts in the seats next to him.

"Yep!" Four called back from a bench in the trailer of Sheldon's hover-truck. 

"Everything secured?"

"Don't worry," said Marie, loud enough so Four could hear her as well. "We made sure to chain him down before I got back in."

"Yeah, it's pretty cramped in here anyway, but he's not going anywhere." Four had her Hero Shot pointed right at the unconscious form of DJ Octavio, encased in Marie's snowglobe prison. The giant eyes of the Great Zapfish stared at her, but it didn't really seem to know what was going on. *That was probably a good thing*, Four thought to herself. Around and under Agent 4's seat was the scaffolding and equipment for the makeshift stage Marie had brought along.

"Are you sure you can fly this thing with all of us on board?" Marie glanced over at the horseshoe crab, raising an eyebrow.

"Please," Sheldon rolled his eyes as he keyed the engine and the truck roared to life. "I carry a full cargo of weapons across to Grizzco and beyond every other month. We'll be fine."

Gently, the truck lifted from the ground and stage of the Grand Octopia Ampitheater, and took off into the sky.

Sheldon's, Marie's, and Four's radios all went off at the same time. "Five, reporting in. What's your status?"

"Go on, Sheldon," Marie said, glancing over at her cousin, who was still quiet and keeping to herself. She wondered what was going on in her head...

Sheldon keyed the mic as he steered the tree out into the open air of the Octo Valley. "Hey there, Agent 5. The mission's a success. Everybody's safe, just tired. How's everything on the home front?"

"You didn't miss anything, really. Just... nightmares about home, if I had to be honest. But nothing's been disturbed, and none of the point sensors have gone off. I could hear the music from up here, honestly."

"I'd believe that," chimed in Four. "Octavio does his music way too high. My ears are still ringing."

"Who?" called in Lily.

But her question was lost. "So I'm guessing you saw what I left you, then?" Sheldon asked, piloting the vehicle past the towering tentacle pillars.

"I read your summary between patrols," Lily said with a sigh. "Didn't have much else to think about so..."

"One sec, Five," Agent 4 said suddenly, their speaking voice suddenly going more serious and professional. "He's coming to."

"Wait, already?" Marie called from the front seat. "That was fast." Keying her radio, she said, "We've got this from here, Five. Go on and head home. We'll chat over coffee soon. I'll send Four the details."

"Alright..." said Five with some uncertainty. "If you say so. Four, your card'll be hidden under the welcome mat."

"Good to know," said Four with some relief. "It'll be good to be back in my own bed after all this."

"You guys take care. Five out."

The radio went quiet.

The hover-truck continued its ascent into the night sky.
