She hit the ground almost immediately, and her eyes snapped open. *Wait, what just...*

It took a moment for her to remember where she was, and realised what had just happened.

*Ugggghh... Thanks, brain,* she chided at herself. *Just what I needed...*

She sat up. She'd apparently rolled off the bench, back at the Cuttlefish Cabin, and the very short drop from it to the ground had jolted her. Rubbing her head, she checked the time on her phone. She'd been out for about three hours.

*Man...*

She got up, and gripped the Splattershot Jr in her hands again, rather tightly. "Well it definitely wasn't *that* bad," she said aloud, to the empty platform, as she looked over at the notes that were slightly scattered on the ground. *When it happened to me...*

She reached over, tidying the notes and replacing them on the bench, then took her radio. Turning up the volume to around where it was before, she noticed it had gone quiet.

*Actually, come to think about it, the Valley itself had gone rather quiet, hadn't it?* There was no more music playing from down below. She decided to call in and make sure everyone was OK.

...Buuuuut she'd better make sure that she did another round around the Hideout first. Make sure she hadn't missed anything else.
