After a few minutes of walking, and calming enough to find the experience of walking through the forest relaxing, she came to a fork in the path. The left path, following closer to the river, went up a gentle rise in the terrain, while the right was more covered by the trees and went around the rise.

Without thinking, she pulled her radio from her belt and spoke into it. "I've come to a fork in the path. What's the way out?"

Marie's voice came through immediately on the other end. "They both lead the same way. Don't use your ink."

"What? Where am I?"

"You tell me, human."

Lily looked around, confused. What was going on here? Hang on, was it just her or was Marie speaking perfect English? "Uhh... I don't know yet."

There was no reply from Marie.

Instead, a new voice spoke through the radio. "Unit 1 to Base. Are you catching any of this?"

Another new voice. "Affirmative, Unit 1. We count two entities of unknown origin, unknown language. Radar shows one new target under the vortex. You are cleared to engage the alien."

What?! Alien?! "Marie, what's going on? I think someone's coming to kill me." Lily spoke frantically into the radio.

But Marie, again, didn't reply. The second unknown voice came back. "Please identify yourself in English."

Wasn't she speaking English right now? "Please, I'm just a civilian. I don't know where I am. I mean no harm."

"I repeat, please identify yourself in English."

...Somehow, while she could understand them, she could not communicate with them. She replaced the radio.
