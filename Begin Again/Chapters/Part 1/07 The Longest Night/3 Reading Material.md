Sheldon's call came in as the orange glow of the sunset began to fade into a deep blue night. It was a very quick message, but from what Lily could make out, something was happening, possibly "it", the big thing they'd been working towards, and both Sheldon and Marie were departing to assist Agent 4, and could Lily please watch over the Hideout.

"Of course," she'd said. Not that she had any other obligations.

So she found herself on an empty Tentakeel Hideout, at night, carrying her Splattershot Jr in both hands, ink tank strapped to her back. Octo Valley wasn't entirely silent tonight - strangely enough, there was the sound of some very muffled music far below her, just loud enough for the bass to be audible. Lily wondered to herself just what was going on down there...

Sheldon had left her some reading material, too - there was a short note on the bench outside of Cuttlefish Cabin, atop a couple of pages of documents. She'd had her attention drawn to them when she'd arrived, but she had decided to wait until she was at least sure that she was the only squid around.

After completing her second pass around the platform, she decided that she was not in any immediate threat and, radio nearby, sat by the Cabin bench and picked up the small note from Sheldon.

> *Agent 5,*
>
> *Received preliminary results back from DNA testing earlier today. I've left you a copy of what I received, with some annotations (laysquid explanations) where necessary. Top page is my summary. Please read when you can.*
>
> *Sheldon*

*Oh, right...* Lily thought to herself.

With everything that had happened, she had almost completely forgotten about why she'd become an Inkling in the first place. She looked down at the papers next to her. The top sheet was covered in the same handwriting, and glancing at the page underneath revealed printed text. *Man, should I really look at this now...?* She looked around, almost hoping for some distraction.

The radio crackled to life at that moment.

"Alright, I'm here Four. Nice work. Hold tight a moment..."

A few seconds silence...

"Holy carp! Did you mean to knock those right off?!"

"Heck yeah, Four! Keep at it, we'll win her back..."

Lily's hand reached for the transmit button, but she stopped herself. *No, maybe not while they're working... I'm gonna have to just face the facts here.* Her fingers instead twiddled the volume on the radio, turning the voices of Marie and Agent 4 down to a whisper. With a heavy sigh, she picked up the papers and read.

About a week ago now, she had fallen into their world, landed in an ink puddle, and been changed from her old human self into an Inkling like many of the inhabitants of the city. She had had a DNA sample taken from her arm, the hope being that she would one day find out why this had happened.

According to the documentation Sheldon had provided, when the sample was handed over, there were supposedly still some "unknown cells" (human DNA, she guessed), which were being eaten away and converted by the Inkling ink that had been absorbed into her body. Not being native to this environment, and indeed not having existed for however long, where most marine species would have at most a mild or irritating reaction to the ink, her human body had experienced a violent reaction as the ink completely seeped into her and, she guessed, somehow, completely rewrote her genetic code, causing her transformation.

That was what seemed to be implied, anyway. In reality, whichever genetic scientist, not named in the summary, saw the Inkling DNA eating away and converting the few unknown DNA cells they had been presented with, managed to isolate a few remaining, untouched cells, and was still working to identify what it belonged to. Sheldon had stated on the page that he could not (and would not) tell where the sample had come from, and that her true identity was safe. But, that said...

Whereas some time before, she might still have been partly human, besides the memories in her head, by now she was entirely Inkling.

Lily set the paper down and stared forward at the lone tree gently swaying in the wind.

*....Man. I mean, I always kinda figured I was nowhere near human anymore. It feels... so heavy to have it be more or less confirmed.*

She got up. Walked the perimeter again, Splattershot Jr hanging loosely in her hand. *I shouldn't feel so bad about this. Why do I feel so bad about this?*

This was her routine for the next couple hours. She tried to distract herself and deflect her emotions by focusing on her task, and ended up stewing in them instead.

It was about 9PM when she gave up patrolling until she fixed herself up, curled up on the bench of Cuttlefish Cabin, in the dim lights of the Hideout and accidentally fell asleep while attempting to calm herself.
