Lily took the afternoon to walk through the city. She used her phone to plot out a path past one of the nearby buildings that supposedly held another human artifact on her way back to the Square.

The rest of the city felt very different to her, and as she walked through the busy streets, surrounded by all types of vehicles and sapient marine life, she felt like an intruder in an alien world, moreso than usual. 

Her nerves stayed with her until she reached her first stop. She looked up at the building the mockup Sheldon had given her had directed her to: the New Albacore Hotel. 

*Whoa*, she thought to herself. *Wasn't expecting it to be THAT tall. Well, I guess it can't hurt to at least take a look...*

She stepped inside, carrying her backpack, strode past the lobby, and into an elevator on the other side. Lily closed the doors and, left to herself for a moment, set her backpack down, and pulled out the Tracker. 

Lily swept the tracker slowly from ground to sky. As Sheldon had predicted, it started to click when it pointed upward. *Damn. Alright.* The tracker went back in the backpack, and she pressed the button for the topmost floor.

As the elevator whizzed upwards, she had a moment to think. She was pretty sure she noticed some scaffolding outside, perhaps if there really was no roof access she could try to climb up that. Hopefully not though... 

The lift slowed to a halt, and the doors opened onto a red carpeted corridor. Agent 5 stepped out to take a look through the corridors. Up here seemed to be some of the bigger suites, with all sorts of fancy names, like the Pacific Suite, or the Marianas Suite.

*Wait, huh?* Lily did a double-take when seeing that one. *Huh. I mean, it makes sense, considering the naming scheme of this world, but...* 

She spent ten minutes walking around the floor, but indeed couldn't find any civilian roof access. There *was* a maintenance elevator that looked like it would go all the way to the roof, but it was locked behind a keycard system, and the main entry point seemed to be a floor below.

*Okay, so when I come back here, I gotta either find a keycard, go up the scaffolding, or maybe... find a way up the side? Surely there's some way to get up there. But I have an idea of the place now... I better get moving just in case someone decides I look suspicious.*

Lily returned to the elevator, went to the ground floor, and continued walking her way to the Square. 

She would make it about an hour of walking later, slipping her way through the fence of the other side of the construction site that separated her from the Square, and crossing carefully and quietly. Using her squid form to slip back through on the other side, in the corner of the Square, she breathed a sigh of relief, and looked back past the site at the city. Smiling, she walked over to a railing near the Shoal, some arcade, leaning on it as she looked through the squid phone's app store for something to try.
