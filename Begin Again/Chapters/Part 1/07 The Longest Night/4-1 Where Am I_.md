As soon as she felt conscious she looked around, confused.

She had come to, in the middle of a forest path. It felt familiar, but she didn't quite understand why. She got to her feet and looked around. The path was asphalt, winding its way through the forest but off the path, the ground was covered in leaves and pine needles. To one side of the path, a small creek ran alongside it, the earth eroded around it from grander times, but now a small stream surrounded by reeds and tall grass.

She remembered the river and the path, but not the infinite forest that otherwise stretched around her. She found herself heading off, the river to her left.

A clap of thunder interrupted her thoughts. Looking up, she saw, partially hidden by the canopy, strange swirling clouds above her. *Wait*, she wondered to herself. *Did I get here from whatever that thing is?*

Somehow she just knew that above her, was some sort of giant portal. How did she know this? This all felt rather weird and surreal. She continued on, pulling out her Splattershot and treading forth carefully.
