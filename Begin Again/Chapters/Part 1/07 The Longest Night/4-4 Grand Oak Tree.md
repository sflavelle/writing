Wandering through the trees, Lily came across a grand oak tree. Its many branches looked majestic as they reached outwards toward the sky. She stared up at it, admiring the beauty of the forest at that moment.

It was then that she started to hear movement. Something, or some things, approaching, their feet loudly stamping the leafy ground somewhere behind her. She rushed for the tree and climbed up, getting up as high as she could until she felt obscured by the leaves and branches, at least fifteen meters up. Then she waited, not daring to move or even breathe, one hand holding onto the branch to stay steady, the other holding the Splattershot as it hung loosely by her side.

Not too long after, five people rocked up, dressed in all black, military-looking gear, and carrying some sort of assault rifle. *Wait - these guys are human*, Lily thought as she silently watched them fan out around the tree. *Then that means...*

She thought back to the path she had travelled on not too long ago. Now she remembered - One of the towns she used to live in had a path like that behind her house which she would walk along to get to the local lagoon. But something was not right - there wasn't much of a forest there, just sort of a strip of mostly-untouched nature between houses and paddocks.

"Freeze!"

*Huh? Oh, shit.*

Looking down, taking her finger off the Splattershot, she realised that she had been found. One of the men was looking right at her, weapon pointed right at her.

"Sweet Jesus, what the fuck are you?" said another of the men as he also whipped around to face her. The other soldiers were manoeuvring into position around the tree, covering every angle of any possible escape. 

"Lay down your weapons and come down. Slowly." The first soldier was more measured.

"Uhh, okay..." Lily said, knowing they wouldn't understand her anyway.

Carefully, slowly, she placed the Splattershot down on the branch, trying to make sure it would not fall away from her.

She tried to do the same with the Splat Bombs, but in the process of placing it down, it did not hold, and it toppled and fell from the branch.

As she tried to grab it, one of the men opened fire.

And that's when things started to go to hell.

The burst of gunfire missed her just fine.

However, two very unfortunate bullets hit the ink tank on her back, and the falling Splat Bomb.

The Ink Tank shattered, and its contents burst out in a wide radius around her.

The Splat Bomb detonated instantly, as the bullet struck it.

This sent ink everywhere.

The surprise gunfire caused her to lose her balance, and she hugged the tree tightly to avoid falling. "No!" Lily yelled, trying to reach out for the now-detonated Bomb.

Lily's ink splattered the tree, coating whatever it touched in the light blue substance. It covered the ground around the tree as well.

The ink also landed on the men.

The five soldiers writhed and screamed as they were covered in the stuff, and Lily's eyes bulged wide. "Oh no no no no no..."

The changes began almost immediately, appendages sprouting from their heads, sending their helmets flying. Their screaming and flailing almost gave her the impression that they were burning up as the changes happened.

One of the men, partway in the middle of their transformation, their body looking freaky, half-humanoid, half-Inkling, their head bloated, managed to choke out a command: "Open Fire!"

Lily started to scramble down the tree, certain one of them would before too long.

But they were quicker. A fourth person, in the midst of their pain, gripped their weapon long enough to unleash another burst in Lily's direction.

These shots met their mark. Two bullets ripped into Lily's shoulder and chest, throwing her backwards off the tree.

*This was it,* she knew. *She was gon--*
