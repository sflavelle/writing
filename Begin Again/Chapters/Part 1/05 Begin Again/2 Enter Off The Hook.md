As she walked past the Inkopolis News studio, following her phone's directions, she missed the gaze of two curious girls sitting at a table inside.

"Are you sure it was the same one?" asked the taller, darker-skinned girl, leaning out of her chair, looking outside at the blue-tentacled Inkling with slight curiosity.

"I swear, Marina," replied the shorter one, eyes focused. "It was exactly the same shape, and it was white on the back. It was exactly the one we gave to Sheldon." Lily passed around the corner, and disappeared from view, so Pearl's eyes snapped back to her friend. 

"I mean, maybe the lil guy can't work it out?"

"Apparently, because she was using it just fine!"

"Wait, really?" This got Marina's attention. Ever the techie of the two, though she couldn't read the strange characters on the phone, she had at least quickly recognised that the phone had been locked behind a password of some sort. "That's exciting! I wonder what method she used to break into it?"

"I'm pretty sure if you or Sheldon couldn't hack it, and this nobody has, it's probably theirs." Pearl crossed her arms, unamused. 

"Huh." Marina thought for a moment, leaning back into her chair.
