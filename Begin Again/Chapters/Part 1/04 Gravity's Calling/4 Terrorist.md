Then the Octoling appeared at the edge, looking down at her. She was in the same outfit as the ones who had attacked her on her first night. It stared down at her through large black sunglasses, sizing her up. Then it smirked down at her.

"Well, look who it is," The Octoling said, the smirk never straying from her features. "And here I thought you were just another squid-brat snooping around where she wasn't supposed to."

She pulled her weapon out. It looked like a sniper rifle. Lily had to assume it was also ink-based, but she realised that she really was in no position to fight back. "W-who's to say I'm not?! You really think you're gonna get away with basically murder?" She yelled back up at her.

"Do you really think you'll get away with your terrorism, human?"

Agent 5 froze. *How does she know who I am? Hang on a second, terrorism?!* "What are you talking about, 'terrorism'?! I'm no fucking terrorist!"

The Octoling took her time aiming down the sights of her Charger, relishing the situation she found her target in. "Five days ago," she yelled back down, "you launched several attacks upon our homeland with improvised missiles, damaging several buildings and injuring personnel. We estimate the damages at about one million coins worth. Not only that," she spat at her, "but when we sent our squad to apprehend you, not only did you resist arrest, but you attacked and incapacitated most of that squad without reason, and disguised yourself as this... this inferior creature to attempt to evade detection. And even in just getting here, you splat one of our Octotroopers? What's your problem?"

She sighed. "But now we have you." The Octo finally lowered her weapon, while Lily looked about for any kind of options. "So I'm going to give you a choice. You can give yourself up and face court, or I can knock you off that beam right now and you can fall to your death. Maybe not much of a choice, but oh well, you brought that upon yourself. So what'll it--" 

She cut herself off. Her eyes had moved away for just a moment, but when they went back to Agent 5, she had gone. The Octoling got down on her front and looked over the edge, but she couldn't see her at all. She cursed in her native tongue.

"Stupid human," she said to herself.
