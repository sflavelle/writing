She came to not too long after, very much an addled mess. As she lay there, looking up into the 'sky', she saw her again.

A long, dangling rope hanging from the platform hundreds of meters above, upon which an Octoling was slowly climbing down.

Lily groaned, forcing herself to get back up. Everything hurt. Her body screamed to just let go, but she tried to push on, grabbing the plastic slab and tugging at it til it came out. She knew it was what she'd come for. Too exhausted and in pain to put it away, she carried it with her, stumbling and limping her way up the strange landscape of screens, now lit up in pure white.

The Octoling, still some ways above, wasn't going to let her escape just like that. The thunk and clatter of a Splat Bomb behind her reminded Agent 5 of that, and she tried to pick up the pace as it exploded just out of her range.

She spotted a small gap between the screens a bit further out, a view of the outside world. Maybe if she could just get there...

She stumbled onward.

The Octoling's boots hit the ground. She could hear her sprinting up toward her. *Oh no*, Lily thought.

The footsteps stopped somewhere close. Lily turned around slowly.

A blast from the Charger knocked her off her feet again. She smacked her head against a screen. Felt it crack. Her vision blurred.

The Octoling casually walked to her, taking her sweet time. She smirked. Lily knew it was over when she'd stepped over her bruised and battered body.

Agent 5's vision focused enough to see her opponent take out what seemed like a jar and uncapping it. *Just a regular old jar?* "Wwwazzatfor?" She said, slurred in her disoriented state.

"Guess you wouldn't know, huh?" The Octo snorted, mounting the jar onto the Charger in place of its scope. "Both our species' has... something that seeks safe territory in which we're reborn. This is to make sure that you don't get away. You will face trial, rest assured of that."

The Octoling aimed. Its barrel was pointed right at Lily's head. Hopeless, the inkling closed her eyes and awaited it. "You'll experience some pain," The Octo said. "But not for long."

Click.

"Guh, really?" She was annoyed. Out of ink, at this critical moment? "Excuse me, this won't take a second..." She turned to her bag to extract another canister of ink.

But Lily, adrenaline flooding through her body from the hope spot, had gotten up as quickly as she could in her state, grabbed the jar from the Octo's Charger, and had pulled out the Splattershot, letting loose a quick burst.

Splat.

In the burst of ink that was her opponent, Lily did notice the shimmers of a tiny squid... spirit... thing. Before it had a chance to float away to safety, she had caught it in the jar and sealed it shut.

Phew.

She was safe.

Somehow.

Putting the jar in her backpack for now, she noticed the Octo's weapon lying on the ground.

The Charger.

She picked it up. It was an impressive weapon, alright. She decided to hold onto it for now.

The danger subsided for now, she used the last of her energy to put the slab of plastic, which she now recognised as a laptop of some kind into the backpack as well.

Then, with the knowledge that the Octo in the jar wouldn't be coming back for revenge anytime soon, she collapsed on the floor and passed out.
