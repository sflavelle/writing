She felt much more alive when she awoke a few hours later. She still hurt, and still felt woozy, but most of the pain was in her head and her back where she had hit the ground. 

She also noticed that the screens had gone black, engulfing the whole place in darkness. *Was it "night time"?* She wasn't entirely sure, but the lack of light made it really hard to navigate back to where the Octoling's rope had been, taking her about ten minutes and plenty of trips.

It took her another twenty minutes to climb up the rope, all the while thinking about the what-ifs. She was no longer in any risk of immediate danger, besides falling down again, but that didn't stop her.

Agent 5 finally made her way back to the launchpad after about fifty minutes total, fumbling her way around in the dim lighting on the platforms themselves. She sat down, putting down her backpack and retrieving two items from it: the Charger, and the jar that contained a very angry Octoling spirit.

She placed the Charger down on the ground by the Super Jump point, and the closed jar next to it.

"Look, I get it," she said to the jar. "I understand, from your perspective, why you guys want me out of the picture. Thing is, I honestly don't know how or why I'm even here, or why I became a squid girl thing. I didn't even know who Inklings, or Octolings, or whoever were until I woke up and your squad tried to get me. I didn't even know that things like... this were even possible." She gestured as the octo-spirit. "I honestly thought you guys were trying to kill me for good."

She sighed, and looked up into the blackness. "I guess I don't blame you, when essentially an alien falls from the sky." Lily was quiet for a few moments, just thinking back on that first night. 

"Those things that fell down, they're mine, but they're just my belongings. I think. I don't even know what most of them are. I'm just... I'm just trying to get them back." She glanced back at her backpack, in which the laptop was poking out. In the dim light of the lights in this entry point, she could make out the reflection of her laptop's Acer logo. She noticed the Octo had followed her gaze. "Like, that's... that's just a computer. I've seen a few in Inkopolis, so I assume you guys have them too. It's... just what it is."

More silence. "There's honestly no reason why I'm not in there and you're not out here." Pause. "Maybe I will turn myself over eventually, once I've at least got my things back safely. I just... I don't know what came through with me, and I guess I want to make sure that my stuff is in my hands, because I mean... stuff like the computer, and my phone, that's basically my identity. And I guess I'd feel better if I was the one cleaning up my mess."

Sigh. She was babbling on now. She picked up the jar and stood. "I guess I just had to get that off my chest. Well, I'm going to leave now, but now that you're not a threat to my getting home, I'll let you go. I'll leave your weapon here, but it's certainly a very nice weapon. I'll have to look into getting one of my own sometime." She grasped the lid, and popped open the jar, and the spirit zoomed out of the jar and looked at her angrily before speeding off into the blackness.

"Well, seeya soon, I guess..."
