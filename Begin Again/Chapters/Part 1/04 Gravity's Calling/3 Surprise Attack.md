A blast of red ink smacked her hard in the back of the head, knocking her off balance, and she started to tip over the edge.

As Agent 5 started to fall, she tried to turn herself around to grab the ledge, catching a glimpse of what had struck her.

An Octoling.

Fuck.

She missed the ledge. Plummeting down.

In her mad attempts to grab hold of something, she managed to get her hands around a length of steel sticking out of the concrete, and slid to a halt, suspended at least a hundred meters in the air.

Agent 5 wrapped her body tightly around the metal and looked back up, shaking. She could at least see the edge from where she'd fallen. She debated in her head whether she could get up enough to at least swim up the wall.
