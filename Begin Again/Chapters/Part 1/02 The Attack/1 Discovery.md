## The Attack

In the early hours of the morning, he awoke to the sound of an automated alarm.

"Warning. Unauthorized intrusion detected." The alarm, coming through a tinny speaker somewhere to his left, then began making whooping noises, before repeating itself in its calm womanly voice.

He forced his eyes awake. It took him a few seconds to realise that he was in the strange room from last time he was awake. He turned his head to the left, towards the source of the sound. It was a radio. It sat on the table next to the bed, next to which was a lamp, a neatly folded pile of clothing, and a weapon of some kind. It was a pile that seemed to be intended for him.

He reached out to take hold of the weapon, swinging himself to a sitting position on the bed, and as he did so realised that his arm was hairless, free of freckles. He frowned. In fact, it really didn't look like his own hand at all. His gaze travelled up his arm and towards the shoulder, and it took for him to finally gaze down his body at his hips to realise this was NOT his body at all.

His mouth hung open. He stood quickly, ignoring the blare of the alarm for a moment as he searched frantically for a mirror. He found one in the dresser and stood before it. Thick, sky blue tentacles hung from his head, like long hair. A sort of black mask had grown in around his wider eyes. Hell, it was just plain to see that the body he had right now reminded him of one of the girls that had been in the room with him previously.

"Oh fuck me..." they said, in a voice that they didn't recognise.

The radio siren suddenly stopped, which cut off their train of thought. Their head snapped to look at the radio, and they reached over to grab the weapon from the table.

They jumped when a less calm version of the alarm's recorded voice came in over the radio. "Come in human. Come in, human." It said loudly. "There are multiple enemies headed in your direction and nobody else is nearby to help you. I'm sorry about what's happened to you, but..."

He... she... they... tuned out the voice as they examined the Splattershot Jr. It looked similar to an Uzi, but painted light gray, and orange in some parts, like it was some offbrand Nerf gun. The hastily-attached rounded container snapped onto the back of seemed to hold... some type of liquid inside, they weren't sure what. Looking over it though, it seemed very similar to the water gun comparison he had made just before.

"...may have to fight them. I'll be there as soon as I can, but-"

A bang caused them to fumble and nearly drop the weapon. They whipped around and focused on the door, weapon trained on it, trembling. *Well, make do with what you have, I guess.*
