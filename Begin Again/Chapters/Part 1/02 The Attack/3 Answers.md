Her gaze followed its trail into the night sky, and then just stared into the stars. 

A minute passed.

The danger seemingly over, the adrenaline started to wear off and the full realisation of what had happened to her began to hit. She sank to her knees and continued to stare outward, thoughts rushing through her mind. She heard Marie walk up next to her, and didn't turn.

They both sat and looked up at the stars for what must have been a few minutes. The cold night air brushed past them, and the naked Inkling began to shiver. 

"Why didn't you put those clothes on?" Marie finally asked. It occurred to the other that she understood the green squid suddenly. She attributed this to the transformation she'd undergone.

"...No time." She finally spoke, amazed at the sound of her own voice. Her older voice was a lot deeper, more... male, of course. This one was strangely more in line with the voice she imagined herself having if she were female, only younger. "I'd only gotten to pick up the... the weapon before I had to..." 

She went silent. Marie understood. 

"I... I didn't just murder, did I...?"

"No. They are still alive, for better or worse. They most likely ended up regrouping back home."

More silence. The Inkling turned her head to look up at her. "Why were they after me, though?"

Marie thought. "That... I don't know. When you fell, you were only out here for maybe five minutes, tops before I got you inside to safety. Unless they saw you fall out of the sky, they really shouldn't have known you were here..." There was a pause. The Inkling realised she was still working things out too.

Marie continued, "If they saw you falling, then I guess they had to have put together that you were that person somehow, and that you were still here... Hmm. And they wanted to take you away..." 

Marie turned to look at her. "Whatever is going on, we won't let you get captured by them. It's... making the best of a bad situation for you, I realise... but you'll like being a part of this world. I promise."

"Now get some clothes on, you silly squid, it's like three in the morning."
