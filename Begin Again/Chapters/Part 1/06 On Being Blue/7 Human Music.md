"Hey," Marie said quietly, a bit of her usual self starting to show again. "Speaking of music, do you have any human music on that phone of yours? I'm curious..."

"Uhh... yeah?" Lily dug out the iPhone and unlocked it. She was glad she'd gotten around to re-training the fingerprint sensor. Opening her music app, she thought aloud, "Hmm, a taste of music or a taste of *my taste* in music...?"

"I mean, either works," Marie said, looking up at her. "Just play me whatever."

Lily looked at her. "Well, if you say so." She dug up the live version of a song called "Randy", one of the last things she had added to her phone from the human world. "I'll play one of my favorites, why not? This one brings me back to the first concert I attended, and while it's repetitive, it was really good at getting me pumped and in a good mood."

She hit play, and let the sound of Justice fill the silence, nervous. As the tempo built up, it all came flooding back to her. The light show, the crowd, the heat, the excitement. She couldn't help but start bobbing her head to the beat when it kicked in, and imagine it all over again, a smile on her face. Marie could feel this energy pouring from her, and couldn't help but join her, sitting up and dancing from her seat.

After three and a half minutes of rocking out, the breakdown into the verse of the song brought some quiet, and before the vocals kicked in, Lily asked her friend quickly, "Do you want me to try to translate?"

"If you think you can."

She nodded and thought hard, trying to recall the lyrics, and with some thought, not following the rhythm, but trying to keep the pitch, translated the lyrics from English to Inkling:

| "Get up and shake it off
| It's time that you listen up and hear the call
| Bail out the water
| Better not, you're on fire
| Back against the wall

| Don't stop
| Try to make your mark
| And make your mind up
| Don't stop
| Work it out and try to make it

| Randy
| Get yourself together
| Got to get it up to make it better
| Randy
| You don't have to suffer
| Step outside and find yourself a lover

| When you know you've arrived
| And it's time, don't shoot low
| Aim it high
| When you know you've arrived
| And it's time, take it slow
| Shoot it hiiigh-iigh-iigh\~"

"Impressive." Marie grinned, bobbing her head as the next part of the song kicked in. "I didn't know you sang. You were focused pretty hard for that."

"Eheh, yeah." Lily had put one of her arms out in the air, and was shaking to the beat. "I had to make sure I didn't accidentally start singing in English with the guys on this track. I reaaally wanted to do that."

"English... is that the name of the human language?"

"Er, one of. I wanna say there was probably more than a hundred languages being used on the planet when I left? English is the one I grew up with, and one of the most prominent."

"Wow. I will say though, you were right. This song would be really good at getting the squids moving. There's a certain quality to it that..."
