Her train carriage was empty as it travelled the city loop. Further up the train, she'd noticed all types of passengers get on, but she enjoyed just the noise of the train as it passed the various stations. According to her phone's map, she was a few more stops away from the Square. Lily's leg bounced impatiently next to her backpack as she waited, her eyes occasionally zipping over to the picture of all the train lines and their stations, making sure she was going the right way and all that.

The City Loop was mostly underground, though it did dip above ground for some stops, giving Lily a view of the city lights, and the brightening sky beyond them.

Whenever the train made a stop, Lily would look outside and see two or three more passengers board, and eventually one of the small jellyfish creatures entered Lily's carriage and sat off to a corner. 

The train eventually announced its arrival at Inkopolis Square, and she got up and exited onto the platform. The underground station was well looked after, two relatively small platforms for the area's popularity which exited through a ramp onto the main square.

While making her way toward the exit ramp, she spotted the musician and news anchor, Marina, exiting from the other end of the train. She didn't put too much thought into this, and made her way along.
