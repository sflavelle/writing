The crackle of a radio in Marie's pocket interrupted her, and she sighed. "Ahh, she had to interrupt this eventually." She pulled it out and keyed the transmit button. "Come in?"

"Hello up there!" came the voice of Agent 4. "How are you both holding up?"

"Better, thank you," Marie said into the radio, looking over at Lily and giving her a thumbs up. "You do alright overnight?"

"Yeah I'm good," came the reply. "Found somewhere relatively safe to hole up."

Lily gestured for the radio, and got it. "When you say 'relatively'..."

"Hey Li-- Agent 5! Yeah, look down from where you are now."

Lily got up from the edge first, then, getting on her front, peeked her head over the edge of the platform.

Waaaaaaaaaaay down below them, on the watery floor of the Octo Valley, were a series of moving platforms surrounding a giant pit, with metal hatch doors recessed into the pit. It uneased Lily. "...Point taken," she said, and handed the radio back to Marie.

Marie took the radio, and keyed it again. "We'll get moving shortly. I know we've still got some things to do first, but with the help of the both of you, I think I'm ready to take this fight directly to him. Two out."

"Four out." The radio went quiet.

Lily and Marie both got up from the edge, and started to head back. "Look, thanks for coming around this morning. I hope that one day once things have settled that I'll be able to explain what's been going on." She took a moment to glance at the back of Lily's head. "At least that cut is healing well. You should be out on the field again before too long."

"Mmm." Lily stared forward. She immediately thought back to the fall. "I guess so, yeah. I'm a little nervous though. I guess I'm just gonna take the plunge and see if there's any way I can get into those Turf War sports and build up my skill without getting my ass handed to me."

Marie nodded. "Honestly that would be best. At the same time, once our work is done, we can probably help you with what's left here in the Valley... I shouldn't promise too much more though, I'm still technically holding the fort here while the Captain's out on business."

"I get it. Hell, you've done so much for me already, in you and Four just acclimating me to the world..."

They had made their way back to the Cuttlefish Cabin. Marie turned to Lily. "Well, so long as it makes our world worth living in, We'd welcome having you in it." She turned toward the door to the cabin, making to enter, but turned back around shortly after. "Oh, before I forget. The News said there may be some rain in the next day or two, so be careful."

"Will do!" Lily smiled, misunderstanding the idea of the message. "You take care, Marie. I guess contact me when everything works out. I'd love to be here to welcome Agent 4 back."

"Heh, alright. Take care, Agent 5."

Marie stepped into the cabin. Satisfied that her job was done, Lily casually binned her empty coffee cup and leapt through the grate to swim back to Inkopolis.
