"Sorry I took so long to get here," Lily sighed, walking up to the little crab fellow. "Still learning the train system. Enjoy your drinks."

"Actually, these are for you to take to Miss Marie," he said, handing them over. "Coffee. Flat Whites. One for her, and one for you since it's still early." He forced a smile. "I'm not a morning person, don't think too well before I've woken up y'see... But I thought this would help cheer her."

"Same here, mate. Uh, friend. Sorry. But, uh, sure... I can take these along to her."

Sheldon raised an eyebrow. "Excellent. Now hurry along! The three of us have important work to do, and a depressed squid is not fun to work with, believe me."

"Well I got bad news for you there, friend." Lily returned the grin. "I'll do what I can. Thanks." 

Sheldon nodded, and waved her off. She turned to make sure she wasn't otherwise watched, and dove feet-first into the grate to Tentakeel.
