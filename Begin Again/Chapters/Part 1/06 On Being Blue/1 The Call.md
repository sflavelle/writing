## On Being Blue

Lily was awoken early the next morning by a pleasant ringing noise. It took her a few moments as she was jolted from her sleep to work out that it was her squidphone! Someone was ringing her!

She sat herself up on the bed as she thumbed the 'answer' button on the touch screen. "Hello?" Lily said groggily as she checked her iPhone for the time. Early 6AM. Still dark out.

"It's Four," came the hushed voice on the other end. "Sorry to wake you."

"Oh gosh! Hey! Are you doing okay out there?"

"Yeah. I mean, it's what you'd expect. Listen, I can't stay long, just in case they can pick up this transmission too."

"'They'?"

"I... have a favour to ask." Agent 4's voice was quiet, and sad. "We um... we found out some things last night. M's real shaken up. Would you go check on her for me?"

"Uh, sure, I can do that. What...?"

"I shouldn't say, not over the phone. Let her tell you if she wants to."

"A-alright. Stay safe. Come back in one piece, alright?"

"I'll try my best, Lily. I'll see you soon." Click.
