A minute or two later, Marie emerged from the Cabin, holding her coffee and dressed, for the first time in a while, in her Squid Sisters outfit. Lily, waiting by the stone archway, stared in awe. "Wow. You're looking pretty fancy there," she managed to say. "Shame about the circles under... around... you still look tired."

"Oh shush," Marie replied, but she couldn't help but smile a bit. She gestured down toward the other end of the Hideout. "There's a good spot down there past the kettle where we can watch the sunrise over the city, if you're into that."

And so, a short walk later, they sat together, feet dangling from the edge of the platform as they looked past Octo Valley towards Inkopolis. The dark blue night sky was slowly giving way to a vivid orange sunrise as they sat there, drinking their coffee. 

"So?" Marie prompted between sips.

"I mean... I don't know where to start. Prompt me."

"OK then, what did your average day look like?"

"Weekday? I guess I could talk about both. I'd... wake up super early, usually it's still dark. Thankfully I have an alarm and all that, and I'd have this smart light so I can just fade it on without getting out of bed so I can wake up better without blinding myself. Then uhh... I'd eventually get up and get ready for work, pack some food, and drive about... half an hour to work?"

Marie held up her hand to stop Lily briefly. "How'd it take half an hour to drive anywhere at that time of day?"

"Was commuting from one town to another. Sure, there were big cities like Inkopolis, but I was kinda on the outskirts of a smaller community. I lived out in the country. That's still a thing, right?"

"Yeah, no, it totally is still a 'thing'. I came from the country! Still got family out there, actually."

"Oh, sweet. What kinda country is out there?"

"This is your story, not mine."

"Oh." Lily paused for a moment. "Well... I lived in this place where there were lots of farms, so there were lots of fields and trees, but I was basically on the edge of this big country city. It made for a nice relaxing drive. Wish work was like that."

"Hm? What did you do for a living?"

Lily sighed. "I had a nice cleaning job for just over a year, got a qualification for that, tried and didn't like hospitality, and ended up in a food production factory right up until everything happened. Basically packing things every day."

"Oh..." Marie frowned. "That's not what I would have thought you did. You seem... above that, in a way?"

Lily took a sip from her coffee and shook the cup. Nearly empty. "It was fine. It just made my hobbies that much more special when I wanted to do them. Y'know, I'd get home in the late afternoon, get on my computer and just... hang out online. Talk to friends. Try and do mashups. Play video games. Just sorta, whatever I felt I could do until I had to go to bed and do it all over again." She was staring down at the coffee she was holding in her lap. "I'm glad I made friends at that job. I kinda miss them. I miss all my friends... But at the same time I just really needed that extra income."

Marie nodded, with a slight smile. "Whatever helps keep you going, I get it. I gotta interrupt you again though... Mashups?"

"Oh, so the idea is, you take two or more--"

"No, I know what they are, just... really? You don't make your own things?"

Lily blushed deeply, and buried her head in her lap. "I'm sorry!" She said, muffled. "I just like having fun with the music... it's my way of learning."

"Heeey, hey." Lily felt Marie's arm over her shoulder. "*You're* supposed to be the one comforting *me*."

"I'm honestly just really bad at making my own music, so I'd play at being a DJ..."

"Look at me for a sec."

Lily lifted her head, and Marie took it in her gloved hands and turned it to face her. "As an artist, I get it. You make music how you want to. Just, maybe don't go claiming it as your own work."

"I don't."

"Good."

Marie gently, carefully pulled the other squid into a sideways hug, and Lily blushed deeply, just sitting there for a moment before slowly reciprocating, hugging her friend close. After a minute, she gently let go, and rested her head on Lily's shoulder as they watched the sun peek out from behind the city.

"Uh, what are you...?" Lily said, still blushing.

"Shhhh. Just lemme have this for a few minutes."

Lily nodded quietly and let herself relax, looking out into the horizon. They let the conversation lull for a few minutes as the two sat together, Lily's arm around Marie's shoulder, and the green squid against her.

*This was nice,* Lily thought to herself.
