The lights of Cuttlefish Cabin weren't on when Lily got there. It was dark, but the sky was beginning to brighten and a red tinge on the horizon told her the sun was not far off rising. She set one of the drinks down by her feet as she stepped up to the cabin, and used her free hand to very gently knock on the door.

There was a slight pause, then a muffled and tired "Yes...?" from behind the door.

"Agent 5. I brought drinks."

"...Yeah, okay. Come in."

Lily picked up the other coffee and pushed down the handle of the door, entering slowly. "It's only coffee, but I heard you weren't in the best way and thought maybe having someone here would help..."

Marie was laid on the bed, a bit of a mess. She looked like she hadn't slept much, if at all. Her performance outfit had been taken out of the closet in the room and was draped over the television. "That's fine," she said. "I mean, I want something more alcoholic, but coffee will do I suppose. Take a seat."

Lily placed Marie's coffee on the bedside dresser, and sat on the end of the single-sized bed as the Squid Sister forced herself up from the mattress, turning herself around so that she was also sitting on the side of the bed next to the other girl.

"Did you manage to get any sleep last night...?" Lily asked her, in a worried tone.

Marie sighed, head down. "Maybe. I think I might've blacked out once or twice overnight, but no, I don't feel like I've slept more than one or two hours."

"Jeez, that bad, huh." Lily frowned, and slowly, unsure if she should, placed a hand on her friend's shoulder. "I can't say I understand what you're going through, but I do know from experience that sleepless nights only make it worse. I... know you and Agent 4 have got a big job ahead of you, so I hope the coffee will help keep you going at least..."

Marie nodded quietly. She reached for her coffee, and took a sip. Lily took her cue and also dug into her drink. *Not as sweet as she hoped*, she thought, *but coffee's coffee. So nice and warm too...*

Lily finished drinking some of the coffee, glancing over at the other squid to see that Marie was watching her. She blushed. "Do I look weird drinking? Sorry..."

"No, no. Just... It's occurred to me I still don't really know anything about you, besides what Agent 4 and Sheldon have told me." Marie thought a moment. "And I suppose, what I've seen of you when I first took you in." She let a small smirk stray onto her features. 

Lily's blush coming back in full swing. "Aw, come on. Of course you'd still remember that night."

"Not even that night though. You were the first living human I, or anyone really, have ever seen. Yeah, it was a short-lived experience, but... hey, some of those memories still have to be in that head of yours, right?"

"...Are you asking me to remember human life for you?"

"Look, I just want a bit of time to not be thinking about Callie. Distract me."

"...Alright. Well, since the sun's just about to rise, do you wanna head outside and we'll talk?"

"Sure. That sounds nice. Just lemme get out of these pajamas. Meet you out there."
