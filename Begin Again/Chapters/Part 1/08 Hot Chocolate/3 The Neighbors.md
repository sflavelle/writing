A few minutes later, Lily left the apartment in an old blue-and-white-striped polo top and some tight-fitting denim jeans. As Four locked the door, carrying a small laundry bag, the two of them caught sight of a next-door neighbor, an older-looking snail lady, entering her apartment. "Hi, Shellie," Four greeted happily. "Night shift treat you well?"

"Coulda been worse, Lorne," Shellie replied with a bit of a sigh. "Y'know how it is with vocational schools. I just hope with the rainstorm today that nobody decides to track mud in. I'll be cleaning those carpets for ages. But at least it pays alright."

The two chatted briefly, and then Shellie stepped inside, supposedly to sleep.
