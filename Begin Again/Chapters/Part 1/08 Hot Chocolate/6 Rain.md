After everyone had made their way to the underground station, and were waiting for their train - the Squid Sisters and Sheldon heading to the Square, and the two Agents back to the apartment - rain had started to gently fall outside. As it increased in intensity, the 'hiss' of hundreds of raindrops hitting concrete reached their ears, and Lily turned to look back at the entrance.

"Good timing, Sheldon," Marie said. "We made it out with minutes to spare."

"Hey, uh, guys?" Callie was turned the other way, watching Lily.

The squid-girl was standing just shy of the entrance to the station and watching the rain fall and thud on the glass roof of the tunnel. Trails of water from outside were making their way down the floor of the tunnel and draining into the grate separating the ramp down to the platform from the platform itself. She sighed happily, enjoying the noise and the sights.

"You should probably get away from there, Lily," Marie called over to her. "Just in case you get hurt."

"Hurt?" Lily raised an eyebrow at her. "It's just water."

"That 'just water' is lethal to us," Callie said, hands in pockets.

"What? That's just saltwater, innit? I'm pretty sure rain is freshwater..."

Callie, Marie and Lorne stared at her. Sheldon had pulled out a notepad and was writing something, presumably about her.

"...Really? Squids can't tolerate *any* water?" Lily was stunned. With a sad look out at the tunnel, she returned to the group. "But... that doesn't make sense! Y'all used to live in the water! What's in the taps then?"

"Natural oils," Marie shrugged. "Not that crude stuff the rigs used to drill for. But that's the stuff we squids thrive on."

"...Huh..." Lily was slowly processing this. "Well, do any of you enjoy the sound of the rain, at least? Or does that just equate to danger nowadays?"

"Danger," Lorne said definitively.

"Yup," agreed Marie. Callie nodded.

"I'm somewhat lucky in that I can withstand the rain," Sheldon said to her calmly, "but I quickly learned to be concerned for my squid friends when it starts to rain."

"Fair enough. ...Wow, that's just crazy to me." Lily glanced back at the tunnel, and the noise of the rain. "Man."

The group became aware of the sound of an approaching train, and Lily went quiet. A loudspeaker somewhere above them announced it as the City Loop train, and they all boarded.
