The carriage was packed. Most of the squid passengers were wearing disposable ponchos of various colors to keep the rain off of their skin. Lily, Lorne and Sheldon had not managed to find a seat, and so stood close together near the seats Marie and Callie had managed to get. Lily watched Lorne pull out her phone and open up some social network app, and they both started to talk about them and which to join. Sheldon joined in their conversation shortly after.

Marie and Callie both sat back, the former looking around at the occupied and idle faces of the passengers on the carriage, the latter checking her phone.

"E-excuse me..."

A soft, shy voice nearby floated over to the Sisters. Callie looked up from her phone, and Marie looked over at the source of the voice. It was a squid, and she looked excited to see them. "Hi there," Marie said, but trailed off.

It wasn't really a squid. With her tentacles tied back and dyed purple, she could be easily mistaken for one, but they had both seen enough suction cups to know that this was an Octoling. In Inkopolis? How...?

Callie picked up the slack while Marie was momentarily stunned. "Hi! Always a pleasure to meet a fan. What's up?" She said, immediately switching into her 'idol mode' and perking up, beaming at this unexpected guest.

The other three had heard the chatter and turned around. Agents 4 and 5 also both recognised the Octo (Lily, a little more slowly) and made to step between her and the Sisters, but Marie held an arm out to stop them. "Callie's got this," she whispered loud enough for them to hear over the noise of the train.

"I, um..." The Octoling girl was trying to overcome her nervousness, and seeing the commotion she was creating with Lily and Lorne was not helping. She made to back away. "N-nevermind, I'm sorry to int--"

Callie grabbed her hand. As calmingly as she could muster in their current environs, she said to the stranger, "It's okay. They're friends of ours. What did you want to say?" She continued grinning.

"Umm... I just wanted to say..." The girl took deep breaths. "I... saw you two at the concert in Octo Valley two years ago. And, er, it honestly changed my life. So... I just wanted to say thank you. While I had the opportunity." A small smile stayed onto her face.

"There you go!" Still smiling, more genuinely it seemed, Callie shook the poor girl's hand. Callie fakes this role really well, Lily thought. "I'm glad that we managed to inspire you with our music!"

"Yeah," Marie kicked in, having flipped her 'in public' switch. "And we're glad you worked up the courage to come and see us. I hope you'll come and see us perform again one day."

"A-absolutely!" The girl's smile widened. "Thank you! Sorry to interrupt you!" She waved and headed back to her seat down to one end of the carriage.

Encounter over, everyone returned to their posts, except for Lily, who wasn't sure what had just happened. She looked about the carriage, but nobody else seemed to have paid much attention to the Octoling girl. In fact more people were pointing and whispering about the Squid Sisters, though she supposed that was somewhat normal. *But still... weren't they the enemy?*

Callie must have noticed Lily's unease, and she said, "It's the glasses. They brainwash people. She doesn't have 'em. She's as good as you or I."

Lily thought on this. That seemed consistent with the behaviour she'd seen so far. "If you say so..." She returned to looking at her phone, installing the social app Lorne had shown her before.

The two agents said their farewells a few minutes later, as the train pulled into the Inkopolis Square station and the Sisters and Sheldon disembarked. Taking their seats, Lily and Lorne waved them off, then quickly returned to their previous conversation, talking about which accounts to follow.
