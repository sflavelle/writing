His head was swimming. So much was going on on him, so many pain points, that he wasn't sure they weren't overlapping.

Then he realised something else. *I'm alive.*

Somewhere amidst the darkness behind his eyes and the pain and the jumbled thoughts in his brain, he realised he could hear. Voices. Maybe. He couldn't quite understand them. He waited for his thoughts to calm so he could focus a little more on understanding these voices. There were two of them, and they spoke... strangely. Like it was another language. But on top of that, it was as if they were trying to talk underwater or something. It was unintelligible to him. He wondered where it was coming from...

He opened his eyes, slowly.

There were two creatures, standing above him, vaguely human but not quite.

He was also apparently naked.

He closed his eyes again. *Welp*, he thought to himself. *Wonderful. There goes my dignity.*

They must have noticed, because one of them spoke to him. It seemed like he was being asked a question. He opened his eyes again to look up at them. "I'm... sorry," he spoke slowly, half in the way one speaks to someone who doesn't understand his language, but half in the sense that he was simply still waking. "I cannot understand you." He frowned.

Come to think of it, how did he end up like this? In a bed, naked, with two ladies with weird head...things over him. He tried to think back to the previous night. He could remember falling... but it was all a blur besides that.

The older, green-'haired' woman spoke again. This time she seemed to point to a picture in a book she was holding. He reached for the book and looked more closely at it. The picture seemed to be of a stylistic human drawing. The next step up from stick figures. He wasn't quite sure what they were implying, but he nodded anyway. "Yes... that looks like me," he said in a deliberate manner.

The girls spoke excitedly amongst themselves.
