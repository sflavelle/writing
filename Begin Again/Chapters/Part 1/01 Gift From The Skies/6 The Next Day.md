The next day was almost like any other.  Agent 4 penetrated deeper into Octoling territory, with Marie only a radio call away. Marie continued to provide tactical and emotional support from her station back home. Even the city, though buzzing with news of the strange objects from the sky, was otherwise going through its regular routine. 

Coming back in from Agent 4's apartment, though, Marie noticed that the human's clothes, hanging on the makeshift line, had mostly disintegrated where their ink had come in contact, to the point where they were mostly scraps. She found this odd, as from memory of their touch she figured that the clothes were made of a similar material to those made today.

Additionally, from reports on the field, it seemed that the Octoling squad that often attempted to take control of Inkopolis's sanctioned Turf War arenas had not appeared at all since the day before. Well they have to be planning something, Marie thought. It might have been almost impossible to know just what, but between radio calls she researched, and tried to work out what the enemy might do, the human far from her mind at that moment.

She only realised how much time had passed when Marie was buzzed awake at what must have been nearly midnight. "Yeah kid... I'm here," she said through a yawn.

"I've found my way to what appears to be a safe area to sleep for tonight," replied her agent through the radio. "Sounds like you beat me to it."

"Yeah... sorry about that. Been trying to anticipate what is happening with the Octoling situation, musta dozed off." Marie looked through her scribbled notes and tried to recall her thought process.

"Oh, don't worry too much about them, I can take 'em," Agent 4 replied with what must have been a cocky grin.

"That's just it though, I don't know if they're coming for you..." Marie paused upon a quick map she'd drawn of the area upon which her abode stood, which was circled. "Listen, before I turn in I'm gonna pull some strings and leave our human friend a weapon and some clothes just in case... I have a bad feeling about this."

"Are you sure about giving them a weapon?"

"No," Marie said quickly. She wasn't lying - she hadn't figured out yet whether the creature was even friendly - but if her troubles came to pass, they would need to defend themselves against a threat she didn't want to see close to home somehow. "We'll splat them if we need to, and I really hope we don't need to, but the way things are looking with our situation, I'd feel better giving them something in case of an attack on us."

"Alright... be careful, ah, Agent."

"You too, Agent 4. Goodnight." Marie blinked her eyes back into focus. She really needed the sleep. *Well, fifteen more minutes to fix him up wasn't going to hurt...* 

She leapt upon the inkline that carried her from the secret recon station to the main platform of the Hideout, and from there swam through the ink trails over to the grate that would take her back to Inkopolis Square. She turned briefly, and her squid eyes scanned the hut and the sky above. It was night, but the moon was out and the stars seemed bright. On any other day she'd have thought this beautiful, but right now she was nervous. *They couldn't know about him... right?*

She turned and slipped through the grate, and was gone.

She returned ten minutes later, jumping through the grate once again and landing back on her feet. She was carrying a biodegradable paper bag upon which the Square's shopkeepers had helpfully placed some starter gear inside for cheap. Black shorts, light gray top, a headband, and a brand new Splattershot Jr, which Sheldon had jerry-rigged a small canister of ink onto the top of. She was proud of the bargaining done to get these things for cheap.

Sheldon had, of course, asked how her 'guest' was doing. His work on the translator was going alright, based on the small amount of language he'd gleaned from the phone the studio across the square had recovered, plus some recordings of the few times the human had actually spoken that Marie had gotten for him, but the translator was not ready for testing yet. She'd had to explain to him that she was busy guiding Agent 4, as he of course knew as he'd also been in communication with her, testing various products on the field. She promised that she'd let him know as soon as she returned to the tent, but that she hadn't heard any noise from him, assuming he was in a deep rest, healing up.

Marie stopped before the door into the Cabin. *What if he was awake in there, though? What kind of look would it give for her to come in with a weapon? What if he was gone?* She calmed her mind quickly and reassured herself, that he would most likely still be asleep, and not hear her come in.

She turned the handle and stepped inside, and quickly realised there was another, altogether very strange possibility she had not accounted for.
