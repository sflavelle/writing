It was unfortunate that they could not understand each other, but she was not giving up yet. She turned to Agent 4. "I think Sheldon may be able to help us out with this, too, but we'll see."

"I wonder if he could whip up some sort of translator..."

Marie placed a hand on the Inkling's shoulder. "We've got our own job to do right now. We'll keep an eye on the human, but we really do need to make sure that we get the Great Zapfish and Callie back. So... try not to worry about him. From the looks of things he won't be going anywhere for a while."

The two stepped back outside. "Which means I'm going to have to find a place to sleep tonight. You don't snore, do you?"
