45 minutes later, right on cue, Marie's radio sprung to life.

"It's Off The Hook, LIVE from Inkopolis Square with breaking news!"

"Oh, you did not, Marina..."

"There are reports of small impacts across the city! Three have been confirmed so far, including one crashing through our very own window..."

"Eyewitnesses say these came down from the sky, but it doesn't appear to be space debris - at least because what we've recovered appears to be similar to Inkopolis' own mobile phones! How weird is that?"

"Other impacts appear to have been made on rooftops with no access, so we don't know what may be lying there, but we'll update you on this story as it develops."

"That's right! And now here's the current battle stages..."
