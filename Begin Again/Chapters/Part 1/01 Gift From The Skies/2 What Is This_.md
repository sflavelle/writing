Marie looked at the strange creature on her bed. She'd removed its stained clothes and put them aside for now. The creature was definitely male, she could see that much... ink had stained his skin and the hairs on his body in various places. It also seemed that he was definitely unconscious, as he still had not stirred.

Marie's abode was small - most of the room was taken up by her bed, on the opposite corner of the doorway. There was a small dresser next to the bed, containing her changes of clothes, including her Squid Sisters outfit. She... didn't feel like she deserved to wear that right now.

The remaining corner was taken up by a mostly decorational, tiny table, upon which sat a portable TV. It was switched on for now - she figured if something had struck Inkopolis, they'd get a message out pretty quickly. So far though, there was no special report yet. Marie checked a clock hanging on the wall. Quarter-past. Hmm.

The squid's gaze laid upon Agent 3's book of Sunken Scrolls, next to the TV. She picked up the book and leafed through the pages, an... odd thought forming in her head. She'd asked Agent 3 for the scrolls after the return of the Great Zapfish to the old Inkopolis Square, as the material inside shed light on the history of her people and of her country. But the sight of the book had brought the memory of one of those pages to the front of her mind...

It wasn't long before she found it - the page detailing the planet's previous majority species.

Humans.

Just looking at the diagram on the page, she could see some strong similarities between the page and the person on her bed. No way, she thought. I thought they were totally extinct. But it seemed pretty clear to her that if this wasn't a human, they were at least very closely related.

*Well, I guess I'd better keep him here out of the way, where he can't be found. Hopefully when he wakes up he can tell us how he got here... but I gotta get back to work.*

Marie stepped out of the room, hung up a quick clothes line for the human's clothes, and swam away to her recon station to assist Agent 4.
