## Gift From The Skies

Marie sighed as her new agent zoomed off to the second area in Octo Canyon, leaving her alone on the Tentakeel Hideout once again.

She seems very capable, her thoughts told her, and she agreed. Possibly even better than Agent 3, but that wasn't his fault - with Sheldon to help us out now with his weapons, and his Enhancifier, we're simply starting out on a better foot than Agent 3 had with the Captain.

Well, now that Agent 4 was safely on her way, she decided that she should make her way to her recon station, somewhere beneath the floating island. The platform had been there when she first went into hiding - once she had found the secret path that hid its existence, she found it was a safe area to set up her radio gear and 'spy' for her Agents.

But as Marie squidded her way through the ink trails left by Agent 4, something splashed deep into an ink splotch on her right. Oh kelp, she thought as she leapt out of the ink in Inkling form, brandishing her custom Splat Brella at the ink patch.

The unidentified object had sent ink flying everywhere - but otherwise she didn't see what had made the splash.

Then she saw the hand.

It was draped over the edge of the puddle, the rest of... whatever it was submerged in the ink. But it was definitely not an Inkling's hand.

Fearing enemy conflict, she slowly stepped through the ink and brought herself before the odd appendage, training the end of her Brella at it.

It didn't move. *What in the...*

She noticed that the hand was slowly slipping back into the ink. It felt as if the poor creature was... drowning? Marie frowned. *How could that be possible?* She put the Brella down briefly, grabbed the strange hand, and pulled. *Oof, whatever it was, it was heavy*. It was definitely not an Octoling either, having now examined it closely - this was some other strange, perhaps close relative to either species.

She struggled, but slowly, she pulled the creature from the ink. Once it had been freed, she rolled the thing onto its back and examined it.

It was definitely not any kind of squid... and yet, it shared some similarities. It had hands and feet, just like Inklings; clothes, just like Inklings... but what was this stuff that sprouted from its body? It covered his legs and his arms, and parts of his face. Marie thought it looked pretty ugly. It was a lot thicker and darker on the top of the creature's head, where her own species would have its tentacles.

She looked up again, scanning the skyline, trying to judge the angle at which this thing had jumped from. But from what she could tell, there was no nearby landmass from which this thing could have launched from. *What a strange thing this is... I guess if it can't survive in the ink, I should get it somewhere out of the way before something happens to it.*

And so she began the slow task of carrying the alien creature over to her hut.
