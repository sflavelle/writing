While carefully stepping through the abandoned town, wondering why this place was connected, Lily came across two Tentakooks also wandering about.

"Gyaah!" The three of them cried, ducking back behind cover.

A few seconds passed, and she hoped she didn't have to shoot.

Then she heard one say loudly to the other in Octarian, "Hey, wait a second man - I think that was the human!"

"What, really?! Can I go look?" His buddy responded, sounding excited.

Lily watched cautiously as she saw the tentacle of the Tentakook peek out first, before the little guy's face came into view, curiously watching her.

She crouched down, reaching out with her free hand. "Hey. You guys alright?" she asked them in their language.

The tentacle blinked at her. Then it grinned, and ducked back behind the corner. "It's totally her! C'mon!"

Both Tentakooks appeared from behind the corner and walked up to her. The first one pressed itself against her hand, still outstretched, and Lily happily pet the lil' guy. "Hiya, Miss Lily!" it greeted cheerily. "It's been a while! What're you doing out here? And why do ya look like one of them smelly agents?"

"They squidnapped her, man!" the other quickly told her. "Weren't you at the king's last show?! They probably forced her to work for them."

Lily bit her lip. "Ah, um... something like that. Uh, but what're you guys doing here in the Metro?" Lily raised an eyebrow, and briefly removed her headset, quickly moving on from the subject.

"Metro?" Both Octarians glanced at each other. "We know nothing about no Metro."

"Then... where are we then?"

"Oh! So this place is an oooooold town that the King says is off limits because of straaaange things that can threaten us Octarians." The second creature seemed particularly proud that he could remember this. "We're patrolling to make sure nothing's in here!"

"And that nothing can break into the rest of Octopia!" continued his partner.

"Huh." Lily nodded. She remembered the one-sided 'conversation' Octavio had had with her about an abandoned town while she was under. "That's fair. Wait... what do you mean 'the rest of Octopia'?" Her brows furrowed. "Are we in Octopia right now?"

"Uhh... yeah?" Both Tentakooks looked confused as they eyed her. "Did something happen, miss Lily?"

Lily bit her lip. "I don't know, yet. That's why I look like one of those 'smelly agents', in your words. I'm investigating something." She briefly explained why she had been sent down to the Metro.

"Ohhh! Well that might be why we've not seen any of those evil Octarians lately."

"They've been down here too?!"

"Yeah!"
