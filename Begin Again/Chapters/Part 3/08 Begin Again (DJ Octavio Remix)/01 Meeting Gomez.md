## Begin Again (DJ Octavio Remix)

The morning after the Great Zapfish capture, Octavio, confident that Lily was under his control, sent her out to the edges of Octopia's reach. Her orders, she remembered, were to 'meet with the team patrolling Opal Springs, listen to their story, and share what you know'.

She had been allowed to wear the glove that covered her blemished skin, and she had been provisioned an outfit normally worn by the Octoling military while an outfit was commissioned. Under the influence of the hypnoshades, and with the new clothing, she felt like she was starting a new, 'better' chapter in her life.

"The

The inkling stepped out of the front doors of the palace, squeezing past several Octarians entering to seek an audience with the king. She blinked - she had forgotten that, while the capital was still lit, the light out here was much dimmer than inside.

"Ma'am! Human! Over here!"

Lily spun around, trying to find the source of the voice. "Yes? Hello?" She asked no one in particular as she tried to find who it might have been. Several Octarians nearby gave her weird looks as they passed.

It had been a Tentakook - seemingly a messenger, judging by its bag and hat. He raced up the stairs to Lily excitedly, and she could see that he was about chest-tall to her. "Greetings! I'm told you're headed out to the Opal Springs outpost?"

She nodded. "That's right. How do you know?"

"The King!" He took a bow. "I'm Gomez, ma'am. The royal messenger. I'm headed out that way, if you'd like to follow me!"

"Uh- Sure. Is it far...? I mean I have decent stamina, but..."

"Oh, yeah, it's pretty far off. But it'll be a breeze with our kettle network!" Gomez grinned up at her. "Have you tried them yet?"

"Only the ones on the surface." Lily shrugged.

"So you get the idea!" Gomez gestured at Lily to follow him, and together they descended the steps into the city. "They get us to all sorts of places *much* quicker than on foot! Speaking of - hope you can keep up!" With a grin, the Tentakook took off at a run through the street.

'Wh--- Ha! Okay!" Grinning, Lily took off after him at a sprint - and shortly after, she tripped in the outfit's high-heeled shoes and crashed down on the ground, having underestimated the effect they would have on her movement. The crash also briefly knocked her glasses off, and she was left dazed for a few moments, her mind a fog.

One of the civilian Octarians passing by deftly slipped the hypnoshades back onto her, as if this sort of thing had happened many times before, and called to Gomez. "Hey, bud! Keep a better watch on your pet!"

"Huh?" The Tentakook turned around, confused, and saw Lily dazed and knocked on her front. "Oh, dear! Thanks!" Gomez easily ran back to her. "You alright there, ma'am? Sorry about that..."

Lily shook her head, getting herself together as she got to her feet. "Urgh... N-no, it's fine. I'm just not used to these boots." She sighed, and blushed, realising she'd made a fool of herself. "Well, guess I'm not trying that again."

"That's okay!" Gomez' tentacle brushed gently along her arm as they set off again together, this time at a brisk walk. "We'll take it easy then! Plenty of opportunity to talk, right?"
