Lily stepped out of the staff entrance of the Starfish Bar a few minutes later, carrying a cup of hot chocolate in her hand. As soon as the door shut behind her and the light from inside disappeared, she allowed the persona of 'DJ Neu Wave' to slip away from her, and her bright eyes and smile slipped away. She slumped down rather roughly on a milk crate next to the entrance, leaning her back into the wall

In an instant, she looked as if she was totally exhausted.

And she was.

Physically, the show had taken a lot out of her. But it had taken a lot of energy out of her emotionally and mentally too - not just the announcements, but just actively being around so many people, being the focus for so long.

This was her routine, though - every Friday night, she'd play her show, then after a bit of mingling with the staff or the crowd, she'd retreat to this backalley, away from everyone and just decompress for a while - and allow herself to fall to pieces, or excitedly celebrate on her own, or whatever the mood called for.

Today though, she'd really played her heart out. It was an important set for an important occasion. She simply drank her drink, staring at the bricks of the building across from her.

*I hope I can top that show at Final Fest*, she thought to herself.

A few minutes of drinking and staring later, Off the Hook would catch Lily's eye as they walked up from the street. They seemed in a good mood.

"Hey, Lil'." Pearl nodded at her as the two approached her. "Great show tonight. I see you've gotten better at the MCing part after our chat the other month. Proud of ya."

"That was an awesome set, Lily!" Marina smiled. "The crowd inside is really pumped to see you perform with us, too."

"I'm glad." Lily yawned, and gave a weak smile. "I feel like I gave it my best."

"You look it. Y'alright?" Pearl raised an eyebrow at her.

"Yeah. Just. Exhausted." Lily reached for a hot drink cup by her feet, and took a sip. "It's part of the routine by now, y'know? I put a lot more of my energy into those shows, that by the end of it I just need... *some* time at the end to get a bit of energy back. I'm still introverted, and all that."

Marina nodded. "You did well, Lily. Are you gonna be alright to get home?"

"Psh. Yeah, I'll be fine." The inkling smiled up at them again. "I gotta make a detour on the way, but I mean, it's a nice night out. It'll..." An unexpected yawn caught her by surprise. "...It'll be nice just walking through the city."

"Gotcha." Pearl smiled. "Good night for it, innit?"

"Mmm. Feels like it." Lily glanced up at the night sky. "Might help me clear my head."

Pearl glanced toward the drowsy inkling on the milk crate. "Hey, you comin' down for another jam session next week?"

"Hell yeah I am. This show ain't putting itself together."

"That's what I like to hear." Her smile grew into a smirk. "You look after yourself, okay?"

"Will do, Pearl. Thanks for checking up on me." Lily smiled, and stood to give each of them a hug.

"Of course, Lily. That's what friends do." Marina also smiled. And she and Pearl started to move again, walking past Lily toward the street. "See you Monday arvo, alright?"

"Sounds good, Marina. Take care, girls." Lily smiled, and shifted her posture, leaning back in a more relaxed fashion against the brick wall of the club, feeling more rejuvenated after the time in the cool air.

"Oh, and don't forget!" called Marina's voice, the girls having paused about 20 meters away. "We're announcing it on the news tomorrow!"

"Got it!" Lily smiled and looked toward them, saluting them with the cup in her hand.

She took a few more minutes to summon the rest of the night's energy, sipping her hot drink. Then, getting up, she walked the two steps toward the staff entrance and opened the door.

Time to get her gear. She knew that her keyboard and other portable gear she'd brought to the show would have been minded by the staff, but she did have to pack it all back into her backpack. She had to move on.

After all, she needed to pay a visit.
