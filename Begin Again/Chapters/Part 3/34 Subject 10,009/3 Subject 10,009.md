Lilynkling> Good evening everyone. My name is C.Q. Cumber, conductor of the Deepsea Metro. I require Lily's superiors, there appears to be an... issue.
Lilynkling> She has just returned to our train from NILS's facilities down here. ...Rather, that was where she was going, and the old telephone has pinged me to pick up a new test subject, which appears to be your Agent 5.
Lilynkling> She no longer remembers myself, or your Agent 8, or what she was doing here. All she seems to really know for sure is she wants to go to the 'promised land' by doing our tests... which is what the telephone would have told her. That is his spiel.
Lilynkling> I wouldn't normally interfere - I quite enjoy seeing all our test subjects better themselves through our testing track - but I have seen what the telephone has tried to do to your agents in the past, and for Lily to come back in such a condition... I suspect foul play.
Lilynkling> In the meantime, I shall get her through any tests that I am able - I suspect I will be seeing new mem cakes awarded to her, and perhaps that will help her.
