# Excuse Me, Have You Seen My Squid?

"Thank you for coming!"

The door to Ammo Knights, Inkopolis Square's weapons store, jingled as yet another customer passed through, leaving with their new purchases. Sheldon, the store's knowledgeable, if over-enthusiastic owner, waved them off with a smile before hurrying across to assist another prospective customer.

Sheldon surprised many with his seemingly unending knowledge on whatever turf weaponry he stocked, especially since he both looked and sounded like a young adult. A horseshoe crab in his mid-20s, he had taken over the family business what felt like five years ago, and grown it substantially through key investments in property in Inkopolis Plaza and then, by a stroke of luck, Inkopolis Square.

His name was short for Shellendorf, wearing his connection to his esteemed grandfather Ammoses Shellendorf proudly. And while he had had no such experience with the wars his elder did, his own experience with the weapons and tech of Inkopolis Turf Wars had landed him a role as Weapons Outfitter for a New Squidbeak Splatoon mission last year - which had seen him get to know the secret lives of the Squid Sisters, and their then-new Agent 4 and Agent 5.

Not that that generated any new business, but in the name of helping save the Great Zapfish, he was happy to help however he could, given a supply of Power Eggs and a target to refine his weapons against.

As Sheldon assisted the customers in selecting an appropriate weapon to purchase that afternoon, the door jingled open again. He turned, and though the inkling entering had shades on and a beanie to obscure her face, he recognised Callie immediately.

"Pardon me, I'll return in just a moment," he told the octoling browsing the racks, and scurried over to the counter. "Greetings, welcome to Ammo Knights! How can I help you today?"

"Good afternoon!" Callie said cheerfully, but Sheldon noted her expression didn't share the same energy. "We're hoping you might be able to help us with a... uh, 'business inquiry'?"

Sheldon raised an eyebrow. Was she trying to communicate in code phrases? It seemed as if she wanted to talk to him about something, that perhaps she didn't want to mention in front of others. "Of course I can! Is out here okay, or should we discuss in my office?"

"I'd prefer a private discussion..."

"Of course, just let me serve this young gentleman first," he smiled as he noted the octoling coming toward the counter with his new weapon of choice.

"Okay, Callie, what's up? Is everything okay?"

Once the customers had been cleared from the store, he locked the door briefly, hanging up a "back in 5" sign, then guided Callie to his office, just behind the door that also led to the shooting range.

Callie slid off her sunglasses. "I know you've been busy but uh, has Lily come by or passed through the Square in the last 24 hours?"

Sheldon's eyebrow shot up again. "Uhhh... not that I've noticed. Why, what's going on?"

She frowned. "There's a possibility she's gone missing. Nobody's seen her since after her show on Friday night."

"Oh dear... that *is* worrying. Although..." he sat in silence in his chair as he thought. "... If I remember correctly, I did see Lily once a couple months back. She was heading to the Hideout I believe. Was a Friday night then too. I was working late, y'see, and-"

"So what's she doing there?"

"Oh. She was just checking to make sure it was still secure. I remember her saying she felt safer checking it out every Friday or so."

"Huh, okay. Smart. Does she meet with her DJ friend out here or?"

"Her whuh?" Sheldon shook his head. "I'm doing cleanup and paperwork about that time, Callie, I don't go poking into other people's business."

"Oh. Sorry."

"For what it's worth though, the Square's usually empty, or nearly empty when I get to go home."

"Hmmm... okay. Hey, does that camera watching the door work?" Callie gestured in the direction of the shop.
