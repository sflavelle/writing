The Inkopolis Botanical Gardens, for which the Inkopolis Gardens suburb is named, is a large park in a less dense part of the city in which all sorts of marine life can walk amongst nature.

Paths through the gardens gently wound around its many plants and flowers, and there were plenty of benches for walkers to rest, if they didn't want to sit on the grass, under one of the many trees that grew throughout the area. 

The canopies cast much of the park in soft shadows, and as two particular inklings travelled down the paths, one of them thought to themselves how nice it was not to have the sun shining directly on them for a while.

Lily Sunden and Lorne Wye would have been together for a year in just two weeksâ€™ time, and this walk through the Gardens was partially to relax and chat about what they wanted to do for their anniversary. 

Plus, there was a spot in the park that Lorne thought Lily would enjoy, and so - even if to Lily the reasoning felt suss - the former was leading them as they talked.

"I was kinda thinking, why don't we go to a later movie showing and have a fancy dinner before? There's that restaurant in Central the girls recommended."

Lily glanced over at her partner, thinking. "A night screening sounds like a fun idea, I've only been to one of those before. What kinda food do they serve at that place again?"

"Nuh uh, Lily." Lorne shook her head disapprovingly. "We're not doing this. I'm *sure* you can actually *eat* the stuff they'll serve there."

"But what if I don't end up liking it? I'll look like an ass if I just send it back or just pick at it!"

"You literally won't, Lily. Besides, you've got *my* tastes, and I don't have a problem with a lot of what's on their menu."

"...Mmm." Lily bit her lip. She tried to come up with a rebuttal, but she couldn't think of one, so she simply nodded.

She supposed she couldn't fight that.

Though Lily had recently cut her hair down to a more manageable length, and the two girls had different tastes in clothing, she started her new life as almost a clone of Lorne physically - transformed via submersion in her ink. She gradually made her own look over the course of the past year, but the most drastic change so far had been with the birth of 'DJ Neu Wave', a persona of hers. With it she'd changed her public look quite drastically.

On the inside she was still the same person she'd always been - shy, quiet, slightly obsessive. Few saw the moments when she lashed out - when she lost control of her emotions.

And only a select few knew that Lily wasn't born an inkling at all.

She had spent most of her life as a human, hailing from a time where humans flourished on Earth.

But she had started to distance herself from that life and embrace marine society, especially in the past six months. Now, she barely considered herself ex-human at all.

But elements of her old life still seeped through, such as her love of nature, which had led to today's walk.

"Hey," Lorne said, waving her hand in front of Lily's face. "Y'alright in there, hun?"

"Huh? Oh, sorry." The other inkling shook the thoughts from her head. "Just sorta thinking back on everything. This park is lovely, I can't believe we've never been down this way before."

"I've been a few times," Lorne replied, smiling. "I mean, not since you arrived, but I know where the best spots are."

"Oh?"

"Follow me," she said, and took off down the left split of a fork in the path, headed toward a hedged area.  Lily matched her pace.

"Okaaay," Lily acquiesced and stepped up to a jog. "I'm like, certain you have some ulterior motive now though. We've *never* been to this park before!"

"Chill, Lil'!" Lorne smiled back at her. "I just want to show you the thing. It's a real nice park, really!"

Lorne led Lily down the path for another minute, through a hedged sculpture and what seemed like a series of mazes happening around the park. She finally stopped when the path led up a slight rise in the terrain and a single locked gate blocked off one such hedgeway. This seemed to be a private space and a sign on the gate itself stated that penalties would be enforced for any trespassers. Anyone with the right key could get in, but they didn't have it, of course.

"Juuust gotta get in here..." Lorne examined the gate door closely - it was corrugated metal, with not much in the way of footholds to climb. The square poles that the door connected to, though... Lorne felt that perhaps she could use those to get up and over. That said... "OK, I have an idea. Lily, get up here, give me a lift."

"Lorne, what are you doing?" Lily asked with a raised eyebrow as she walked up to the gate.

"It's fine. C'mon." Lily reluctantly lowered herself onto her knees, and felt Lorne's weight as the inkling climbed up onto her shoulders. As she stood back up, Lorne also began to stand, and Lily glanced up as her partner was able to easily climb up and over the gate, leaving Lily on the other side.

Moments later, the gate opened on the other side, and Lorne was there. "Told you. Come on, Lil', it's just ahead."

Past the gate, more hedges lined a short winding path into the main area of the garden, where--
