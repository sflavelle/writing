"...I can't believe you just did that."

"Wouldn't have had to if you had stopped taking it all so seriously."

"Pearl, you *had it on your phone*!"

Pearl and Marina, after the show, were bickering in the studio. Passersby glanced in through the windows with varying amounts of concern and excitement as Marina paced about the studio floor, having relapsed into anxiety while Pearl watched with some amusement from her chair.

"Well yeah, had to make sure I was thinking of the right law," the inkling said casually as her partner anxiously passed by her for the nth time. "Again, you're taking this way too seriously."

"You're not taking it seriously *enough*!" Marina gasped at her. "Splatfest isn't the time to enforce your anarchic anti-capitalist fantasies upon everyone!"

"It's not any of that! Besides, they'd tear me apart in an anti-capitalist society anyway cuz I'm still rich." Pearl shrugged. "Ya need to chill, 'Rina. We'll figure out what we want."

"But *think* about it!" Marina stopped and turned to face her, distressed. "The world might fall apart! *We* might fall apart!"

"...Why, though?" Pearl raised an eyebrow.

"Well what about Off the Hook?!"

"What *about* Off the Hook?" She tilted her head quizically.

Marina stared at her for a few moments. "Ugh! Nevermind..." She strode from the room. "I need a drink."

"Don't go too far!" Pearl called after her. "We've got that thing to go to, remember?"

Pearl wasn't sure if she'd heard. She sighed and flopped back in her chair. It was hard to calm Marina when she was like this. Sometimes it felt like she would get an idea out of thin air and run with it - like the many times she had had to try to convince Marina that, yes, Inkopolis still loved her, and no, everyone had not suddenly learned what Octolings were.

And Pearl appreciated that Marina was on Team Order because she didn't want to lose what she'd earned. But that was Pearl's point - if she didn't leave that bubble, even a little bit, she'd miss out on tons of unique experiences! She'd miss out on opportunities to reimagine herself, redefine who she was!

She freely admitted to herself that she had a bone to pick about her own past, though.

Sometimes she regretted her upbringing. It was only because she wanted to connect more with the people of Inkopolis than with the rich socialites and CEOs of Inkopolis that she had had her rebellious punk phase.

That phase had led to her exile from her former band, and the discovery of what she had heard called 'the voice to end all voices'.

That said she was amazed that her parents still did a lot to support her, even if sometimes it was simply financial support.

And they had supported her when she started Off the Hook with Marina, moreso than she had expected. Maybe they were just glad to see her become less of a punk and - well, more of a 'princess'.

They'd done this gig for a good while, and it had been wonderful, performing around Inkopolis in all the different clubs and stadiums and arenas. To Pearl, she just... felt it was time for a fresh change of pace.

And if she could help creativity bloom in Inkopolis at the same time, all the better.

*Oof... Maybe I wouldn't wanna do anything too rash though. Don't wanna hurt my family after everything they've done for me.*

"...Huhhhh..."

That was gonna take some thinking.
