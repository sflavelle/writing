## The Final Fest

"Look, I'm not saying nothing should ever change... I just want to protect the balance I've found in my life."

As the crowd of people watched in Inkopolis Square, and many more tuned in over the radio or on TV, Pearl and Marina were getting themselves worked up over the topic of the Splatfest they were in the middle of announcing.

Two+ years of being on the air, of the continued success of Off the Hook, of being the representatives for this Splatfest season, was culminating in this coming month.

And boy, this one was a doozy. 'What kind of world do you wanna live in', indeed.

Marina took a deep breath, and uncovered her face. The discussion had brought up a few sensitive memories, and she had needed a few moments to collect her thoughts. "Don't... don't you think it's important to create a place where we can all feel safe and secure?" she asked her cohost, with a hint of concern.

"Not if it means living in a world where everything is predictable," was Pearl's immediate response. Pearl had a *point*, but it seemed more than any other Splatfest that the hosts were talking past each other. Not that most of the kids playing Turf War minded - they *loved* the drama that came with Splatfests.

"I mean, look," Pearl continued, adjusting herself in her seat. "I'm not saying I wanna watch the world *burn*. I just want it to *change*. Daily," she threw in as a hasty addition. "I wanna go skydiving one day, walk away from explosions the next, and chill at home in my jammies the next."

"Pearl, you can already do those things. Today."

"Heck no I can't!" Pearl spat. "It's always 'work' this, 'meeting' that! 'Social taboos'!" She had no idea where she actually wanted to go with this, knowing she was still beholden to the people that kept them on the air. "I just wanna do something new, every single day. Make something new, eat something new! Anything less is *boring*!"

Marina's eyes went wide, and she seemed to have been hurt by her words. "Sure but... 'make something new'? That could lead to Off the Hook breaking up!"

"Oh my cod! Are you *squidding me* right now?!" Pearl pinched the bridge of her nose, sighing deeply, taking a deep breath. Pulling out her phone to make sure she was thinking of the right article, she stated, "I'm so done with this. I hereby... (yep, okay) ...invoke Article 4 of Splatfest Law."

Marina's mouth dropped. Her hands snapped up to cover it.

"That means," Pearl continued with a smirk, "the losing side has to accept the world the winning side wants."

"...you wouldn't," Marina breathed.

"Juuuust did."

It took a few seconds for Marina to parse what Pearl had just pulled.

She'd noticed Pearl checking her phone, and realised her cohost had been thinking about this for a while, since they had both known about the upcoming Splatfest topic for a just under three days, prior to announcing it today.

Where Marina had had her own thoughts about how to interpret 'order', it seemed to her that Pearl's idea of chaos was to literally change *everything*.

And that frightened her.

"...But..." Marina finally stuttered. "If... if your side wins, what's going to happen to Inkopolis?"

Pearl, incredibly, *shrugged* at her, making a vague "i'unno" noise. "I'll figure it out during the Splatfest."

*She hadn't even thought about it yet?!*

"And this last Splatfest is gonna be three whole days, so you'd better think about it too, 'Rina."

Marina let out a sharp exhale, turning away from Pearl, the camera and the teleprompters for a few moments. "Hoooo....boy..."

This had gotten *real*.

The octoling thought back to when she had first met Pearl, up on Mount Nantai all those years ago. Exiled by her former band, she had gone up to scream and vent her frustrations at the world. Marina, newly-escaped, could hear her powerful voice from miles away.

And throughout their working relationship, she had seen plenty of instances of Pearl wanting to 'burn it all to the ground' when things seemed particularly unfair.

And now the Splatfest shrine wanted to give *her* the reins to the city.

She loved Pearl, but she was certain that not a lot of people would enjoy Pearl's idea of 'chaos'... This couldn't stand.

*...Well, I suppose that if* I *won, I could tweak things here and there in my favour...*

*But man... why put this in* our *laps, Splatfest shrine...?!*

Marina took deep breaths, thinking hard. 

"...OK." She slowly turned back. "I... guess then that I'm gonna have to start designing *my* perfect world."

"You get on that," Pearl nodded, still smirking. "We've got four weeks to prepare. And not just our plans for Inkopolis," she added, the smirk becoming a teasing grin. "Like some special gear?"

"...Oh! Right, um, yes!" Marina had managed to forget for just a moment that there was *other* stuff going on for this fest finale. "We are collaborating with two different labels to bring everyone some exclusive gear just for this Splatfest!"

"And Marina's handing me the reins for her final Shifty Station," Pearl grinned. "Everything aside, we're gonna bring y'all the best Shifty we can. Worthy of the finale."

"Oh! AND," Marina squealed, starting to get excited again. "we'll be bringing you all a very special Splatfest show, all three nights! We're gonna send off this season with a *bang*!"

"That's the spirit!" Pearl smiled. "We'll bring you more details closer to the big event, so all of you, go vote for your side, and next month, fi... *play* like the world depends on it!"
