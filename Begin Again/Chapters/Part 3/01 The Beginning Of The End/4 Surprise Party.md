"SURPRIIIISE!"

Lily squeaked, almost jumping out of her skin at the sudden noise as she and Lorne were suddenly greeted by a group of their friends.

Not just any old friends, though.

These people were the New Squidbeak Splatoon, of which they were a part.

They were all here, gathered and seated on the grass around a picnic rug.

Cap'n Craig Cuttlefish, the Splatoon's leader, smiled warmly up at the girls, next to a portable stereo and a few bags and boxes.

Callie and Marie Calamari - Agents 1 and 2, as well as the Squid Sisters - waved up at them, having been in the middle of talking with...

...Remo Redd - Agent 3 - who stood and nodded at them with a smile...

...and Agent Eight - er, Agent 8 - who approached them with a grin, embracing Lily and Lorne. "Happy anniversary, Lily," he said softly.

"Eh?" Lily blushed and glanced at Lorne as Eight hugged them. "A bit early, but uh, wow, hey guys, thank you..."

Marie shook her head with a chuckle. "It's been a year now since you arrived in Inkopolis, Lily."

"That's right!" Craig called, raising a bottle of what seemed like apple cider. "And why not have an overdue get-together to celebrate one of our Agents?"

"What? You guys kept track of that?" Lily blushed deeply, and turned to Lorne. "You knew, didn't you?"

"'Course." Lorne giggled, and hugged her as well. "We wouldn't forget such an important event, are you kidding?" With a smirk, she nudged her along into the group.

"But what about the key?? Are we supposed to be here...?"

Lorne, in response, grinned and produced the key from her pocket. "Yeah, Callie booked the place for a few hours. And I had to play the part, y'know."

"Hah. Well... you got me. T-thanks everyone..." Lily smiled, her face lighting up, as she took a seat with her friends around the picnic rug, next to Craig. The two shared a gentle fist-bump.

"How've ya been, kiddo?" Craig asked her as Lorne took her seat and began to talk with the others. He was wearing the green outfit he used to wear back in his time in the Deepsea Metro. "What's it been, a few months since I last got to hang out with you?"

"Something like that. Time flies, dunnit?" Lily replied back with a smile. "I haven't been too bad. Having a lot of fun with the shows I've been doing lately. Oh, would you please, Cap?" She took one of the paper cups that Marie was offering to the group.

"Of course." Craig opened the bottle of cider, smiling as he filled Lily's drink with the frothy liquid, then poured some into his own cup. "Would you, Callie, dear?" He held the open bottle toward his granddaughter.

"Sure, Gramps!" Callie took it and began to fill hers and the others' cups. "When're we gonna give her the stuff?!"

"Chill, cous'." Marie glanced over at Lily with a smirk. "Yeah, we got together to pick something out for you. I think Eight and Remo got you something too."

Remo nodded, glancing over at Eight and smiling warmly.

"We'll get to it," Craig smiled at them, nodding. "We're just waiting on someone."

"Ah, alright... Man, you guys didn't need to get me anything." Lily blushed and covered her mouth.

"Shhhh, course we did," Marie smirked. "We're basically family!"

"You three *are* family!" Lily grinned.

"Yeah, and we look after the four of you, so. Far as I'm concerned, we're all family. So nyeh." Marie poked her tongue out toward Lily, and before Lily could come up with a response, the conversation had already moved on.

As the group began to talk with each other and settle in, catching up with each other with everything that they had been doing over the past few months, Lily relaxed and drank with the others.

After talking more with Craig about what they had both been up to, trading stories, he began to talk with Lorne and Marie and Lily walked over to join Eight and Remo, who had gotten together about two months ago.

The two were an interesting combination, and she had thought when they had first hooked up that Eight would be too much for the inkling boy. After all, Remo had traded most of the time he *would* have spent exploring relationships and his sexuality to become Agent 3 and defend Inkopolis (and the Metro) with Craig - and as a result was shy and slightly timid in a relationship setting, which Lily found amusing in comparison to Eight, who as she discovered came from a more sexually casual society. Eight, however, had taken it in stride, and was gentle and caring with his partner, at least around Lily - not forcing Remo into even something as little as holding hands if he sensed the inkling felt uncomfortable.

Eight also happily chatted about his time in an all-octoling Tower Control team, and how they were practicing and climbing the ranks. Like Lorne and her Splat Zone squad - the West Inkopolis Warriors - he had gotten into ranked battle and was happily sticking with it. It seemed the skills he and his teammates had honed underground, and his own time in the Deepsea Metro - a nightmare he regardless wished he could undo - made them a challenge for anyone who opposed them.

Callie and Marie's new album as the Squid Sisters was going well, as they told it, if slow-going. It was a choice they had made after the events of last year - a recommitment to each other, and a decision to diversify, even if a little, from their iconic S-Pop style. As part of the production they had chosen to include two choice songs from their solo albums, and record a new song incorporating them both - Marie had told Lily that they had performed it quite accidentally last year in Octo Valley, and had decided to persue the idea further.

They weren't sure when the album would be done, though their producers were trying to push things along - but felt that they were close to a stopping point and hoped that the agents would give it a listen.

And as for Craig... though he dabbled in rap in his spare time, and had hung out with Off the Hook on occasion and chatted (and rapped) with them when they weren't touring, nothing really stopped his vigilance for the New Squidbeak Splatoon. A lot of that time was now spent in Inkopolis, keeping an ear out for gossip or rumors.

But for the time being, there seemed nothing to report. It had been the case for a few short months.

And that in itself was cause for celebration.

"Heyoooo~!"

A few heads turned as two more girls approached the group from the gate - Pearl and Marina, as it turned out. Both of them were still in their iconic clothing from doing the news.

"Hi, everyone!" Marina gave a little wave as they both sat down with the group. "Morning, Lily! Happy anniversary! You doing well?"

"Good, thank you! Yourself?" Lily gestured for the cider bottle, and poured two more cups for the girls.

"Uhh - yeah I'm fine!" Marina nervously chuckled. "Just, y'know, Splatfest announcement day, things got a little heated..."

"Yeah, you guys see the news this morning?" Pearl took the cup that Lily offered and took a swig.

Lily shook her head. "No, sorry. I missed the morning bulletin walking out here with Lorne."

"We did!" Eight grinned up at them, and wrapped an arm around Remo's shoulder. "You two doing okay?"

"Oh, yeah, yeah we're fine, Eight. Thanks. It's all a show and all, hahah..." Marina's face was telling a slightly different story, though.

With Off the Hook joining them, Marie and Craig felt ready to give Lily's gifts, and begin the picnic in earnest. As the group unpacked the food from the various bags, Marie gestured toward Callie, who grinned excitedly and slid over a short but large box to Lily. "So, I know you told us not to go overboard, but blame our folks back home for most of this."

Callie, Marie and Craig watched intently as Lily lifted the lid on the box, greeted with a carefully folded and pressed sky-blue apron, matching Lily's ink color. On top of the apron sat a woven headband and wooden sandals. "What *is* this...?" Lily asked as she lifted out the headband and sandals. It seemed obvious to her that whoever had prepared it had taken proper care to maintain and present it. "It looks like an outfit of some kind..."

"It sure is!" Callie grinned. "This is a traditional garb that inkling cultures wore back in the day."

"Or *still* wear, for large ceremonies," added Craig, with a warm smile. "The folks of Calimari County still involve these old-fashioned outfits for their celebrations."

"Right... Wow." Lily was in awe as she carefully lifted the apron out, to find a traditional shirt underneath. The shirt was folded such that its black hem was prominent. "So which part of this is your parents' doing?"

"To be honest, pretty much all of it." Marie chuckled. "We told them you were interested in 'lifestyles outside Inkopolis', and asked if they would have a shirt made. They sent back, well... all of this."

"That's... wow, that's incredible. I'm gonna have to find some time to try this on. Thank you so much..." Lily smiled widely, and leaned over to hug the three of them, one at a time. "I promise I'll take good care of this."

"I'm sure you will," Craig nodded, smiling.

"Hey, We got something for ya too!" Remo smiled as Lily carefully put the traditional outfit back into the box. He grinned at her as she handed her a much smaller box, inside which sat a fishing lure, with pink, yellow and sky-blue feathers. "I know it's probably not much to you," Remo commented, "but when you asked us to get you something 'uniquely Inkling', this was one of the first ideas we had. The idea is, if I may demonstrate..."

He paused as she took the lure and hooked it into the belt of Eight's jeans. "So, the idea is that you would display it if you wanted to attract a mate. But, y'know, you've got Lorne 'n' all, and..."

"I feel like you knew about the colors. What they mean." Lily gestured at the colors of each feather.

"Yeahhh, Eight suggested it."

"Well, he's right on the money." She grinned and plucked the lure from Eight's pants, and tucked it into her own. "That's so cool! Thanks, guys!"

"Hey, what? You two gave her a *lure*?" Lorne had glanced over and seen the feathers hanging off of Lily's hip. "Whose idea was that?"

"It's a *cultural* gift, relax!" Eight chuckled. "I promise I'm not into her, Four. Although...~"

Lily's face went red, which was immediately followed by hearty laughter from Eight as she handed the lure to Lily. "I'm kidding, I'm kidding! Enjoy it, Lily!"

"I-I will, thanks..." Lily mumbled, still blushing.

After that, everyone sat down to eat. The gathering was relaxed as everyone shared stories, and there was a general feeling of excitement in the air as everyone hung out with each other as one group, something they had not done in months.

At one stage, after the meal, Callie was so eager to see Lily wear the traditional clothing that she convinced the other to head behind one of the hedges and change clothes - Callie assisting her in putting it on, helping her to wear it correctly as a matter of family pride.

When the two emerged a few minutes later, the inkling blushing hard but smiling and wearing the outfit well thanks to Callie, the others gathered cheered her on, and after Craig and the Calamari Cousins had had their photo taken to send back home, the rest of the gathering piled in for a big reunion photo to comemmorate the event. It was a photo full of smiles, none wider than Lily, who was thrilled to have been surprised for such an occasion - she hadn't even thought much about her arrival date being anything to celebrate, even if it had changed her life, like anyone else gathered today.

As the gathering started to lull, and everyone was stood and chatting in little pockets, Pearl and Marina arpproached her and Lorne as they chatted about the morning's surprises and their plans for the rest of the day. "Yo, Lily!" Pearl called out. "Pretty good morning, huh?"

"Yeah!" Lily smiled up at them. "Thanks for coming out!"

"Yeah, thanks for showing up, girls," Lorne smiled.

"No worries at all, thank you for having us." Marina smiled, leaning her head forward in a slight bow. "Sorry we didn't bring you anything."

"Psshhh, it's fine! I'm just happy to have everyone here." Lily bowed her head as well.

"Of course!" Pearl grinned and leaned in. "But, hey, while we were here, we wanted to talk to you about some idea we had."

"Alright, shoot."

Pearl and Marina glanced around despite themselves, and inched closer to the girls. Lily and Lorne inched closer so that the four formed a circle.

In a conspiratorial whisper, Pearl began, "Well, we have an idea for something we want to do for Splatfest..."
