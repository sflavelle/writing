Someone came to retrieve her an hour or so later. Two more Octarians, one an Octoling, broke the silence inside the holding area as they walked in and arrived at her cell.

"Get up," the Octoling said, in simple Inklish. Like the squad that had captured her, she wore the black shades with the red light over her eye. "The King will see you."

Lily was placed into cuffs and led through several corridors. They left the building they were in, and Lily could now see that they were in the midst of an underground city - albeit one were the only lights were provided by the massive globe in the ceiling of this particular cave pocket... and the grand building her captors seemed were leading her toward.

She found this odd, but it hadn't quite clicked why to her yet.

It wasn't long before she was marched into DJ Octavio's throne room, before the King. He was in the middle of conversation, again in the Octarian language, with one of the guards at his side, but his eyes lit up at the sight of Lily.

Octavio looked tired, noted Lily. As she was. She estimated nearly two hours had passed since she had gone to visit him on the surface, making it about 11PM.

He called out to the group surrounding Lily, and after he had spoken they had dispersed and left the room.

"Lily! Ayo!" Octavio called to her, fluidly switching to Inklish. "Welcome to my digs! How ya settlin' in?"

Lily watched him as she carefully stepped closer. He looked more relaxed here than she'd ever seen him. She supposed, after all, that was because they were on his turf now. "I, uh... I didn't realise I was coming with you," she replied bluntly.

"Gahahah! You thought, after all the music, chat and even the flirting," the Octobot King waggled his eyebrows at her, "that I would leave you behind? You'll make an excellent addition to our music scene! Your knowledge could advance Octarian research even further forward! And besides..." His face took on a very smug, smirky quality. "Don't think I'm not going to make good on your various 'offers', my dear."

Lily's face flushed beet red and she turned away in embarassment, to the laughter of Octavio and his guards.

"I must admit though... As glad as I am to have you here with us, you being here is... for my safety."

Lily blinked, turning back to him. "For... *your* safety?"

"While we may be friends, I am still painfully aware that you are one of those blasted Squidbeak Agents first." Octavio's glance shifted, staring off into the distance.

"And...?" Lily was still somewhat confused. "Yeah, I understand you probably did bad things before I even got here, but---"

"Oh, Lily, you naive soul..." He sighed. "Even if you had just let me leave... I imagine as soon as your friends found out they would be down here massacring my people again, and I wouldn't have a chance to enjoy my freedom before they were back at my door..." Octavio looked away for a moment, thinking of other things.

But, after a moment, he shook himself, and his usual self had returned. "Anyway, we'll not dwell on that! You will be under my employ for the time being. I will arrange for lodgings and an induction." His eyes lit up, thinking forward. "First things first, we'll need to bring power back to the rest of Octopia. Then I think a grand concert at the Amphitheater should raise morale. You and me. It's time we collaborated on something *big*, Lily."

Lily stared at him, considering the plan. Considering where she was, and that the guards posted in this room having spears and doubtless other weaponry, and the fact that she was locked out of her squid form, she didn't have many options. "I mean... if I have to stay, then... that all sounds well and good. But just... Octavio. DJ. Please consider the 'solar' conversation we had before. Alright? I know power's a priority, but... you're just going to give... *us*, the Squidbeaks, a reason to come back down here if you try to take Inkopolis's power."

"I *know*, but we can't just take your word for it and hope for the best, human! We need *some* sort of power injection in the meantime! That Great Zapfish they have up on the surface is one of *the* best power sources we know of right now and the longer our people go without a larger power source, the worse off they'll be!"

Lily stopped. He had a point - she didn't know how big Octopia actually was. Surely places like this were powered by regular Zapfishes, right? Ones they'd stolen - maybe *had* to steal - and she supposed Inkopolis found it managed just fine without one missing here or there. They had to operate without battery storage though, where they clearly needed something, perhaps multiple somethings... Lily found herself struggling with how to reply.

"I... I don't have an answer for that. Just please try to avoid it. We will find you something, promise. If I have to trust you, Tavi, then you *need* to trust me."

Octavio sighed, and shared a roll of his eyes with his guards while Lily wasn't looking. "Very well, my dear Lily. For now, we should get you acquainted with your new home. Tonight you will share my quarters, and I'll arrange for guest quarters in this palace to be made available to you come the morning. Okay?" 

Lily looked up at him, and with a sigh, nodded. "Understood, Octavio."

"Good, good!" Octavio grinned at her. "Now then, I'll have you escorted there. I'm sure you, like I, are very tired. I'll be with you shortly, I have a bit more business to attend to." He then spoke to one of his guards in Octarian, and after his instruction the tentacle creature departed its post and moved toward Lily, pointing her toward one of the doorways with the tip of its head.

Lily obediently began moving along.

"Hey! Hang on a second." Both of them looked towards Octavio, who was searching around his throne for something. "Gotta get those cuffs off... ah, here we are. Catch!" He lobbed a small key in the direction of the Octarian, who caught it in its tentacle. It pulled Lily's arms toward its body, but then stopped and glanced toward the King with a concerned look.

The King nodded, and said something in response in Octarian. Lily wished she could understand the language.

With a nod, the guard deftly inserted the key into the handcuffs' lock, and turned. Immediately Lily felt the cuffs open, and she pulled them off, nervously watching the creatures around her as she rubbed her sore wrists. They tensed, but otherwise didn't react - only the guard behind her, who again pointed Lily in the direction of the doorway.

She quietly followed the guard's order.
