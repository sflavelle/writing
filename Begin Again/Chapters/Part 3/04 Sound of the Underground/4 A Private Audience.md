Lily was shoved through the door into DJ Octavio's private quarters. Immediately after, she heard the door shut and lock behind her.

The room was, quite simply, magnificent.

It was quite a grand bedroom - gold marble columns in the corners, polished rock checkerboard flooring, and a white chiseled ceiling converged around a large four-poster bed, atop a soft red shag carpet - strangely off-center, leaving plenty of blank space to the right side - filled only with a few chairs to one corner.

*A lot of space where 'fun' could be had*, Lily bet herself.

On the left wall was an open doorway into what looked like the King's private bathroom, similarly grandiose. She walked over to it and peered inside, seeing the usual amenities and quite a large bathtub inside - more of a tub than a bath. Lily supposed it had to be, for an octopus of his size.

There was no other doorways to leave the room, and because she was underground, no windows.

She walked back to the door she had been pushed through, and experimentally tried the door. Of course, it wouldn't open. "Anyone there?" she said to nobody in particular.

A few angry, muffled Octarian wahs and burbles sounded in response.

The door was being watched.

She well and truly was in the trap.

"Ffuuuuck."

Lily stepped away from the door, lifting her hands to her face and letting out a deep sigh. *Nothing left but to eat the cheese.*

She sat down on the King's bed and waited.

About fifteen minutes passed of pacing about the lavish bedroom before she heard activity outside of the door, and DJ Octavio slid into the room. "Good evening, my dear," he said as his demeanor visibly changed, becoming more relaxed.

Lily heard the door lock behind him.

He crossed the floor to her, and his tentacles wrapped up around her and pulled her to his body. "You have no idea how much it means to me, to have you here," he softly spoke.

"Again, Octavio, you brought me here. *Against my will*, might I add." Lily's emotions were conflicted, but she felt cold toward him as she spoke.

"Aw, c'mon kiddo..." The octopus held her tighter. "I told you, I don't have a choice in the matter. What about all the time we've spent together?"

"That's one thing, this is another!" Lily snapped at him, pushing against him, but his thick appendages prevented her from escaping his hold. "Tonight you're asking me to throw away everything I had before! Don't you see?!"

"Lily, I am not, why would--"

"'Come live with me, Lily'! 'Put your knowledge to use for us'!" Lily struggled angrily against him, prompting Octavio to only hold her tighter, the tip of another tentacle rubbing over her head. "You know I live with my partner! You *know* it's taken me a year to settle into living in this world!"

"I *know*!" Octavio released her from his embrace, holding her at tentacles' length with two of the appendages, trying to project a reassuring expression. "But I've been trapped in the one spot for a year, and *I* want to return home, and I don't want to *lose* you and everything we've built!"

"Why would you think I wouldn't keep coming to visit you?!"

"Because your friends would put two and two together and forbid you once they realised I was gone!"

Lily paused, silent for a few seconds before creasing her brow. "The hell are you talking about...?"

"...Lily..." Octavio's expression shifted, and his eyes seemed to show worry. *That was different*, Lily thought to herself. "Did your friends ever *know* that you were seeing me...?"

"...Not so regularly, I think..."

"...Listen to me, Lily. Suppose they found out I left to return home. And then they find out you were seeing me on the reg. Who do you think they'd blame for letting me go...?"

"...No way..." Lily's expression began to fall.

"What do you think they'd *do*, thinking you'd freed *me*, an *enemy* of your New Squidbeak Splatoon...?"

Lily was silent. She was confused, but just the thought of her friends abandoning or hurting her over a misunderstanding like that...

Because she kept quiet...

"Lily..." Octavio started again, speaking carefully. "I know things are scary right now. This isn't what either of us wanted. And I know my soldiers are a little overzealous. But we'll figure this out. You and me."

"...Are you sure?" Lily stepped toward him again, now nervous and afraid.

"I'm sure, my dear. I have to get my kingdom back in order, but I promise you: I *will* return you to the surface, and I *will* find some way to make our relationship work, *and* keep your friends happy. It will be difficult, it might take time, but you and I will find a way through this."

The inkling slowly nodded. "...O-okay..."

And after a few moments, she leaned into his embrace. Octavio slowly wrapped his warm tentacles around her again, and this time she reciprocated, still nervous but more willing this time. His words seemed to comfort her.

Octavio, too, relaxed as he felt that the inkling girl had been pacified. Part of him felt some guilt about having to lie to her like this, to get her to come on board. He hated to admit it, but he did have *some* feelings for her...

In the end though, he'd ensure that she didn't have to hide her feelings from him.

He'd ensure that she would stay.
