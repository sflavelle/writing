## Sound of the Underground

The Respawn.

Just over a hundred years ago, it was the culmination of studies into Inkling and Octoling death, and the little flying squid (or octopus) that always emerged from the body after being killed, floating seemingly randomly, before disappearing into thin air, never to be seen again.

The studies had shown that these spirits were formed from a pouch of ink once thought to be part of the creatures' main supply. Nerves and neurons would pressurise and burst this special ink sac as their bodies took too much damage and gave in, bursting the body and preserving the mind in a small, near-ethereal squid/octopus form, so light as to be capable of flight.

These spirits were so light, in fact, that living for too long seemed to cause their end as the particles in the moving air would tear them apart, the spirit dissipating into nothingness. Later experiments, after the war, would confirm that places where the air did not move - like octo-made contraptions like the Preservation Jar, which was... a jar - would keep the spirit safe, but this was considered unethical until the Respawn technology was fully discovered.

They seemed to be drawn toward large, deep bodies of ink. If they reached these pools and submerged in the ink, they were able to return to life - given a few hours or even days to reform, depending on the extent of their wounds. The spirit would often be disoriented from the experience, and even after this their survival was not guaranteed.

Advancements in improving the speed and success rate of the Respawn process led to specialised 'high-pressure' ink pools and respawn points. These pools kept the supplied ink warm so that it flowed easier, which, combined with the pressurization, allowed an instant respawn with a virtually perfect success rate.

This technology completely changed the life of inklings and octolings, allowing them to live a full life - only passing on to the next when their elderly bodies had degraded, and their respawn sac was no longer functioning.

It was through the Octarians' ingenuity and technological aptitude, and the Inklings' stubbornness and curiosity, that both species reaped the benefits of a guaranteed long life.

And it was the Octarians' new understanding of death that made them a terrible foe in battle.

Negotiations over the slowly shrinking land mass that the Octarians and the Inklings lived on, between the Great General Octavio, of the Takowasa Clan, and representatives of the Inkling Coalition - including the Lord Jelly, Jelensi, and Captain Craig Cuttlefish of the soon-to-be legendary Squidbeak Splatoon - collapsed into all-out war, taking place over several awful years.

With the invention of the Respawn, and both sides of the fight making full use of it, it should have been a bloodless battle over territory.

Octarian creations - hybrids of tentacles and machines, called Great Octoweapons - descended upon Inkling bases and outposts. The mornings for inkling-kind brought despair as they often woke to find their bases overrun.

Each day brought new terrors on either side of the divide.

But during the war the Octarians, with General Octavio at the head, also used their new knowledge of respawning to fight an underhanded battle, throwing a wrench into the Inkling forces' plans. Developing devices to contaminate the ink in inkling respawn pools, replacing it with their own - or to disrupt the shifting of the enemy's form, and in doing so prevent the spirit from forming at the point of death.

Ensuring their target *stayed* dead.

They should have handily won ownership over the land.

And yet, the Octarians *lost* the war.

Their failure to secure the surface came down to several factors, historians agreed.

One: the non-octoling Octarians never evolved or grew a respawning sac, and so once they died, they were gone. And there were far more of those tentacled soldiers than humanoid fighters. And so, for each small victory the Inklings won over the Octarians, the size of the General's forces shrank more and more.

Two: The infamous onslaught on the Inklings' central military stronghold. Connecting the Great Octoweapon to a central power socket and allowing the machine to run rampant as the Octarians stormed the fortress should have made capturing it a piece of cake. But, due to a clueless inkling not paying attention to where he was running, the Octoweapon was disconnected from its power and, drained from the long march to the stronghold, shut down almost immediately, leaving the Octarians to bear the full brunt of the defenders.

Three: Inklings just... had more limbs.

And four: The Squidbeak Splatoon.

Captain Craig Cuttlefish (or Cap'n, his preference), Ammoses Shellendorf, and two handpicked inklings - and the splatoon's mascot, Judd the cat - quickly gained a reputation among the Octarians for sneaking through their defenses, or breaking their way in with weapons they had not seen before. They would compromise installations, and clear a path for other forces to take territory, and assassinate key figures in the Octarian military.

They were punishing in a way most inklings weren't.

And when the Octarians had been pushed back as far as they could, and were pinned between the inklings and the ocean...

...Then, and *only* then, did General Octavio Takowasa admit defeat, through gritted teeth.

Due to the bloodshed committed by his people, they were allotted a few square miles on the coast for which the Octarians could decide what to do. Obviously they couldn't swim, and they couldn't fly... but with their machines, they could dig.

So dig they did.

Under the watchful eyes of inkling and jellyfish guards, the Octarians shamefully filtered underground.

Until the Octarians were gone from the surface entirely.

General Octavio and his two Clan Elders, greatly intelligent octopi that had symbolically forgone the 'octoling' evolution, had decided on a plan early on: dig *deep*, to dig *large*.

Living deep underground, deeper than perhaps the inklings expected, afforded them the space to grow again as a species. To build the communities, towns and cities that they needed to thrive. They could expand as much as their civilization needed, and the surface dwellers would be none the wiser.

In later years, as their technology advanced, they would (accidentally) come across two great artificial structures in the ocean, somewhere outside of what was rapidly becoming Inkopolis City on the surface. Satisfied that this *technically* wasn't owned land on the surface that the Inklings would cry foul about, Octarians set about colonizing these areas too - using them as gateways, miniature hubs for their new transport system, as well as just a mesmerizing destination to visit.

The years went by and the new land (underland) of Octopia grew and reestablished itself, but it was said that General Octavio became more unhinged, often thinking about the surface that should have rightfully been his, and fantasising about a war that the Octarians would win.
