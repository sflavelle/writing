Five octopi leapt from the open kettle at the other end of their transit from the Octo Canyon's surface.

Four pairs of Octoling boots thumped on the ground by the defeated Octo Oven's platform as they shifted back to an evolved form.

And a large fleshy 'whump' reverberated throughout the arena as DJ Octavio landed behind them.

The Great Octoweapon's arena was empty. As it had been for a year.

It floated above Tentakeel, a quiet Octarian town in the cave it was situated in which was connected to the surface. Below, buildings carved of clay and rock rose up into the air, small but two, sometimes three stories tall. 

But the soldiers weren't here to socialize with a machine.

"Right, so, your plan was...?" The DJ asked the squad's leader in Octarian, with a raised eyebrow. "We're trying to get *home*?"

"Don't mind my saying so, boss," Lux, the leader of Forward Squad Ceph, replied. "But without your flying transport, Mori's figured this out as the fastest, safest route back home."

"That's right," Mori chipped in, carrying her Charger in one hand as she inspected the town below. "We descend from the platform into Tentakeel and head north to their kettle. We take it to North Station, from there hop to Central and from there you should know the way to the HQ. Easy."

"That's rather pedestrian, isn't it?" Octavio grumbled. "Isn't there a faster way?"

"If you could Super Jump, boss, we could have just gone straight to Cephalon HQ..." Mori shook her head. "In the meantime, as Lux said, this is the fastest way."

"I don't like your tone, Mori." Regardless, the king followed as the octoling squad proceeded onto the platform and walked across to an edge, where Lux pressed on a hidden button in the concrete with her boot.

Two metal rails hydraulically lifted away from the side of the wall pivoting on an axis as it lifted above the lip of the platform. From the ends hung metal ropes on pulleys, trembling as the service elevator it was connected to unlatched from beneath the arena and rose to meet them.

Kae strode over to the gate of the elevator platform and held it open with her offhand, a huge smirk on her face. "For you, king."

"And what about you lot?" Octavio grumbled, looking over the four octolings. "There's not room for all of us on this thing."

In response, Lux and Mori grinned and changed forms, Super Jumping as octopi off the edge of the platform into the city below. The Roller girl gave the king a brief glance, then followed after her leader.

"Oh that's real nice," Octavio grumbled again, rolling his eyes as he resigned himself to slither onto the elevator. "Leaving your leader to ride on this old thing."

"Sorry, DJ. Them's the breaks." Mori grinned. "You want me to ride down with you?"

"I'll meet you down at the bottom," the octopus sighed, and jabbed a tentacle at one of two buttons on the panel that started lowering the elevator. "Since when did you lot become so mean?"

"We've *always* been the way we are, you know that." Mori watched him from the lip of the platform. "We must be doing something right, you still love us."

Then she too, shifted forms and launched downward into the buildings below, leaving the octopus to ride alone for several minutes.

*Damn brats*, he thought.

*If only they weren't so good.*

In the late evening at the dimly-lit Cephalon Central Transport Hub, two Octarian guards that watched over a locked door were barely able to keep their eyes open, or the spears held in their singular tentacles upright.

Every day, they watched the citizens of Octopia enter and exit this large circular building from the kettles lined around the walls, or through the large doorway leading out into Cephalon City itself, the capital of Octopia.

The nights, however, were much quieter. Occasionally an Octarian would walk by and say hello on their way to their destination, but a lot of the night shift was silence. Occasionally the travellers would stop and ask, "what's behind the door?" or make some sort of smalltalk.

The door the two guards looked after led to kettles leading to military-restricted areas. For example, with the right access one could access the central military command centre Cephalon HQ, or the munitions depot of Weaponsmaster Beaker, or several defensive and offensive outposts dotted throughout the underground network.

Under additional security measures, one could also access Palais Takowasa directly. Specifically, areas restricted to only the King himself, and his retinue.

Ergo, only DJ Octavio, the Octobot King, could access this particular kettle.

But why would he?

Yes, his Octobot Mk II airborne DJ booth-turned-missile craft had been badly damaged in an assault by the New Squidbeak Splatoon a year ago, and the King himself captured - but there were easier ways for him to access his home than--

"Excuse me, we need to access the palace."

The Octarian soldier snapped out of his deep daydreaming state, and his tentacle lifted the helmet on its head to better see who had arrived.

It was Lux - the leader of Forward Squad Ceph - leaning over the creature. She led a team well-reknowned for its prowess in battle. Octavio's chosen few - acknowledged as the 'best of the best'.

Behind her were the rest of FSC, waiting patiently.

"Ahem!" The soldier made a loud noise, startling their partner into waking up, and both knocked the butts of their spears on the ground. "Sorry, ladies. You know the backrooms of the palace are accessible to the king only. You're free to access the barracks--"

"Just let us in, bozo," said a deeper male voice behind them.

The soldier's brow creased and he tried to look around the girls at who had replied to him - only to squeak and shrink back as the unmistakeable head of Octavio Takowasa raised up from behind Ceph Squad to peer down at him.

"Eek! I-I'm sorry, my liege!" The soldier shivered in fear, as did his friend. "I-I'll get that for you right away!"

The spears clattered to the ground as the soldier's tentacles grasped the rungs on the large door, pulling it open. As soon as it was, they, and the group of Ceph Squad and Octavio, strode in to the restricted room.

The gold-plated kettle caught everyone's eye immediately, sitting in the center of the array of destinations before them. Its lid was still on - affixed to a hinge controlled by some authentication mechanism to the side of the kettle.

The second soldier ran up to the machine, turning to face the group. "N-now, my king, if you would just present your tenta--"

"I know how this works," Octavio said dismissively, slithering forward and sliding his tentacle into the cylindrical hole in the machine. Inside, a series of lasers and cameras began to measure and compare the presented appendage to its records.

"Y-yes, sorry sir." With a short bow, both soldiers scurried away, out of the room.

"Wow, you're short tonight," Lux noted once the soldiers were gone. "Is it cause we fired on your *girlfriend*?"

"Lux, I will crush you." Octavio removed his tentacle from the machine as the lid began to open for them. "I'm mostly short with you lot. That exchange didn't have to go the way it did."

"Blame the inkling, sire." Lux tapped at the jar tucked into her belt with a clawed finger, spooking the little blue spirit inside, and with her other hand gestured for her team to proceed. "She could have come quietly, but she chose to fight. If I remember right, *you* were the one to dispatch her."

"Yes, well... once it started I *needed* to stop it."

Lux smirked. "What's your plan with her, then?"

"You know *exactly* the plan with her," Octavio replied, allowing himself a small grin as he watched the other three octolings proceed into the kettle. "I'll explain further when we actually get there. I've got big plans for her and her history as a human."

"Hm. They're twelve thousand years dead, boss. Are you sure anything she *or* they have to offer will be beneficial? Octarian scientists have already deciphered the human language and alphabet."

"Have we? Since when?" Octavio raised an eyebrow, and gestured toward the kettle, moving toward and then dropping inside.

"Surface spies smuggled that initial research down, from what I understand," Lux continued once she and Octavio arrived on the other side. "Teams down here did the rest."

The kettle had taken them to an 'exterior' space carved into the rock. An ornate doorway opposite the team led into the private areas of Palais Takowasa itself - kitchens, sleeping quarters, bathing areas, meeting rooms, and of course the King's private quarters.

"Ahaaa," Octavio said with an air of realisation, nodding. He gestured the team forward into the palace, looking relieved now that he was finally home. "Lily must have given that information to the Inklings, then."

"And your scientific contacts brought it down to HQ." Lux grinned. "I suppose your human could have her uses, then. Besides the usual," she added with a smirk and a wink.

"I'll pretend I didn't hear that," the DJ commented, but grinned back at her.

The group turned a corner in the elaborate hallways of the palace, and Octavio stopped by a seemingly random door. This door, looking just like the others they had passed in their short walk, led into Octavio's bedroom.

"Right, I need to freshen up," he said to them, "so I'll leave you here. Respawn Lily out in the compound and put her in holding for a bit while I sort things out here and, well, figure out what we're going to do with her."

"Will do, boss." Lux saluted him, and her team behind her did the same. Her other hand curled around the jar at her hip. "Welcome home."

"Thank you. Thanks for breaking me out, team. I'll have your orders in the morning. Dismissed." Saluting them with a tentacle, Octavio then deftly opened the door into his quarters and disappeared inside.
