The Cephalon HQ compound, lined with rock-solid brick walls, housed three separate yet integrated entities.

Fort Cephalon - the primary training grounds of high-ranking Octarians (mostly Octolings) and rising stars in the Octarian military.

Central Intelligence - the 'home of information'. The forward squads' eye in the sky, and the link between the individuals on the surface stealing or copying secrets from the Inklings, and their counterparts back home.

And the Palais Takowasa - home of the ruler of Octopia, its general... and its entertainment.

Though the area around the three entities was walled off - save for a gate leading into Cephalon City which was overseen by two Octotroopers - the area between them was often used as a social space between members of one establishment or another. It seemed the only lit area in the city - bathed in the glow of the palace. Often one walking through would see many different Octarians walking about, talking, or engaging in training exercises.

At this very late hour, barely anyone was around as Forward Squad Ceph strode from the front doors of the Palais and down the steps into the courtyard, with Lux now actively holding Lily's jar in her clawed hand as they headed toward a respawn point - a sickly purple color, the ink color of the Octarians.

"Now remember, team," Lux said in Octarian as they strode toward their goal. "This girl speaks in *Inklish*, though she has been known to speak the human English language. You want to speak to her, use one of those dialects."

"And if we *don't*?" Mori asked with a small chuckle.

"More power to you," was Lux's reply.

They reached the respawn point and glanced over the flowing ink's surface inside.

"Alright. Respawning her in 5."

Lux took the jar in both hands, glancing down at the little spirit that had been trapped inside that had endured its journey. The squid inside was clearly fearful, worried for what her captors would do to her.

With a smirk, the octoling took the jar's lid in her other hand and spun it open, the lid clattering to the floor.

And before the spirit could attempt to escape from the jar, Lux knelt by the respawning pool and dunked the jar into the flowing ink. She removed the now-empty jar from the pool and placed it on the ground.

And she, and her team, waited.

Lily could feel almost immediately that something was wrong as she was reformed.

She felt ill. Was that the fear? She wasn't sure. But as her hands gripped the lip of the respawn point and she pulled herself from the Octarian ink, a series of awful sensations washed through her body.

She suddenly felt as if her insides were burning. The ink that she had ingested through the reforming process was not as pleasant as that from the surface. It was like she had been poisoned. Surely they had intended this. God, her insides felt as if they were on fire, it was-- oh god--

The inkling had barely managed to climb out of the pool before she was sick.

On all fours, trembling, her captors had flinched and backed away as the pool of sickly blue and bright purple ink, immiscible, never quite blending, grew beneath her.

The octolings hadn't quite expected that reaction. They'd never seen respawning have an effect like that on a creature.

It took a minute for the initial wave of illness to pass, and Lily stayed in that position, taking deep breaths of the stale-tasting underground air and attempting to cough out the awful taste in her mouth. She still felt a fire inside of her, consuming her body, but after the initial flash, it no longer felt like something simply too hot for her body to contain.

For now.

Ceph Squad inched closer as they watched to see if she would be sick again. After a minute of two, when it seemed that she wouldn't, Lily was hauled up to her feet.

The ill feeling intensified as a Disruptor was quickly placed on her back - vibrating her entire being and preventing her from changing into a squid to attempt escape. "Ggghh... P-please, where are you taking me..." she asked, woozy and tired.

"Holding," said Lux simply in Inklish. "Until the King needs you."

She moved ahead as two of her team grabbed her arms on either side and roughly led her into the fort barracks. The roller octoling followed along from behind them. 

They did not at all trust her not to make a run for it.

The nearest cell door inside was opened and Lily was shoved in, and before she could stop stumbling from the momentum, it had shut with a metal clang.

As she faced them again, still feeling ill, three of them were already walking off. One had lit a candle opposite her cell, providing her with a minimal light, dancing, flickering. The remaining octo, the leader, eyed her through her glasses. "Someone will retrieve you," she said.

As she began to walk off, Lily had a flash as she remembered something about them. "Hey!" she yelled at the exiting octoling, slightly slurred as she held her stomach. "You look familiar. Did I fight you last year?"

The leader paused, and after a moment slowly turned towards her. Examining her silently.

"Hey," Lily repeated.

The octoling's eyes reached her own. Lily could feel her gaze on her through the black shades, the slowly pulsing red light over its red eye staring right into her.

And then the octoling smirked at her.

Without a further sound, she left the room.

Lily was alone. Left to herself.

Trapped in a small cell with no lights, no windows, three solid rock walls...

She sighed deeply, and slumped down on the small metal bed provided, holding her stomach and burying her head in her other hand. She still felt as if she had been poisoned, and though purging had helped, her body still felt hot and she still felt weak. And the constant hum of the Disruptor meant that nothing was quite settling down.

How on earth had the simple act of respawning done this to her?

It's not like ink pools had done this to her before. She'd shared an ink pool with her octoling colleague Agent Eight, even - and had no ill effects. *Why now?*

*...I suppose if I'm going to be down here, I'll find out eventually.*

Lily took a deep breath of the cool air, trying to calm her mind. There was no point trying to soothe her body - whatever ink was flowing in her veins was going to be there for a while.

*Well... first thing's first. Now that I have a second, I need to radio in.*

She didn't have the radio on her anymore, but she did have her phones. As she reached in her pocket for her squid-shaped phone, she hoped that she--

Her pocket was empty.

She bit her lip and tried her other pocket. Empty too. *Uh oh.*

She didn't usually keep anything in her butt pocket, but she tried anyway. Nada.

*Fuck.*

*This is bad. Really bad.*

It seemed then she had no access to the outside world.

Lily hoped desparately that her attempted distress call earlier, back on the surface, had reached someone.

Because if not... how long would it take for one of her friends to realise she was missing?

Forget that - how long to find out *Octavio was free*?

She wondered what his plan was. Was it simply to return home? Why the secrecy around his departure? Was he *that* concerned that the New Squidbeak Splatoon would come after him?

Even so - did he really not trust that she would keep her mouth shut? Why did these octolings get involved? Why were they treating her so roughly? What was up with the respawning pool?

What had he done to warrant him being stuck in that snowglobe in the first place, anyway?

She began to pace nervously about the cell.

*I think I might have been told once...* The memory of what she had been told though was difficult to recall - lost somewhere in the blur of time between the period of her arrival in the world of Inkopolis, and that business with Commander Tartar.

*Whatever had happened before must have been real serious...*

*Just what is he going to do with me?*

Lily became aware that there was no other noise in the jail. *Am I alone?* She stood slowly, and walked up to the cell bars. "Anyone else here?" she asked the darkness beyond her cell.

She waited a few seconds, but got nothing in reply. No voices, no footsteps not even the quiet breaths of someone trying not to be discovered.

Besides herself, she was truly alone.

And all she could do was wait until she was called for.
