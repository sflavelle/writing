After Lorne had left the supermarket, carrying her haul with her as she walked the rest of the way to her apartment, she dialed the number Marina had given her during one of their last gatherings.

It took longer to get a response, but when she did, the octoling on the other end was more than happy to see who was calling. "Lorne, is that you? Hi!" Marina's voice sounded over the phone.

"Hiya! How's it all going today?"

"Well, thank you! We're getting off of work soon, actually. I'm hoping to just kinda figure out some ideas with Lily when she gets a chance."

"That sounds great! So uhhh, that sounds like... Lily isn't... there with you guys?"

"Hm? No, we haven't seen her today."

"Oh..." Lorne bit her lip. "That's worrying. She wasn't at Eight's, so I hoped maybe she'd crashed with you guys for the night."

"No, sorry... We did see her after the show, and she seemed fine - if tired, you know how it goes - though she mentioned-- Hm... She mentioned detouring to somewhere on the way back to your place..."

"Eh? I didn't know anything about this. Lily might be in trouble then!" *Oh this was not good...*

"Oh, jeez, yeah. If she didn't make it home... hoooo boy." Marina paused, and Lorne heard her speak in muffled voices to Pearl, presumably in the room with her. "So you know nothing about where she went off to?"

"No... Oh, dear." Lorne took deep breaths. "Okay, I'm nearly home, did some shopping, if she's not home yet I'll ring her again, then uhhhh... I guess I could try the girls?"

"Oh, hm. Yeah, maybe it's weird secret Splatoon business? Definitely try them."

"Alright. Hey, was Lily... *okay* when you saw her?"

"Huh? Yeah. Just tired. I guess more tired than normal, but y'know, a big show like that, takes a lot of energy from you. I don't see how she couldn't make it home though... Hey, listen, if she's not home, let us know and we'll do a little looking of our own, because this sounds real strange of her."

"Yeah, I'd appreciate that. Thanks, Marina."

"No worries at all. Hey. I'm sure it's just something silly. Maybe she's organising something special for your one-year anniversary."

"Heh... Maybe." Lorne was sceptical. "Look, thanks for talking to me. I'll let you get back to things and I'll keep you informed."

"Sounds good, Lorne. And hey, be sure to take care of yourself too, alright? It's no good if you stress over it all day. She's a big girl. As I said, I'm sure it's just something silly."

"Thanks Marina. You two take care."

"You too. Seeya!" With a cheery voice, Marina disconnected the call.

Lorne was left there, with a slight frown.

"Hi Lorne, no she isn't here."

"Hey-- wh-- What the _fuck_, Remo?! I haven't even said anything!"

"Sorry. Yeah er, I'm at Eight's and I overheard him talking to you before."

"Well gee, thanks." The unexpected reply had made the inkling a bit tetchy. "Well, any ideas?"
