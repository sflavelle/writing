## The Morning After

In Inkopolis West, in a seven-story apartment complex on the main road, Lorne Wye awoke as the sun peeked up over the buildings in the distance.

Slowly gaining consciousness, hearing the sounds of the city below through the open window, she blinked open her eyes. It had been a cosy sleep - though, like every night she had to sleep with Lily out doing something or other, it was one that felt strange. She was used to the other's presence in the bed each night, comforting, warm, reassuring...

She turned slowly in the bed, expecting to see her snoozing peacefully beside her.

She wasn't there.

This wasn't entirely unusual on a Saturday morning, but she still felt somewhat hurt that she had not come home.

It wasn't unusual because she knew that Lily would have spent the night at Eight's place. This usually happened when her DJ set had left her drained and tired - she could just walk a short distance to the octoling's apartment, get some rest, and then head the rest of the way home when she felt ready. And because she knew that she would have made the announcement of her career last night, she would no doubt have been totally drained after that show, at least emotionally.

So for now she accepted it, and rose out of bed sluggishly to dress and make breakfast, flicking on the bedside clock radio so she had something to listen to in the meantime. 

"*...once again reminds inklings to please refrain from painting graffiti on or inking the exhibits. And now onto the day's stages! Pearl?*"

"*Before we do that, Marina, isn't there something we should talk about first?*"

"*Huh? What do- oh! YES! It's time for a, ~Splatfest update~!*" Marina, live at the Inkopolis News Studio, sang the last words as if they were a jingle.

"*That's right! Exciting news to do with the Splatocalypse coming up in just a few weeks!*"

"*Yes! First of all - hang on, Pearl, you're calling it 'Splatocalypse'? That sounds a bit... dark, doesn't it?*"

"*It's going to change Inkopolis forever, 'Rina, you can't say it's not appropriate.*"

"*...I suppose, but... ahem, anyway: let's start with the Splatfest concert! Our usual show's going to go just a bit differently this time around, as we alluded to previously.*"

Lorne's ears perked up as she finished pulling on a shirt. *I hope Lily's awake to hear this.*

"*Yep. Folks, y'all know we put on some bangin' shows. But we need to go one step further for this final 'fest. And to do it, we're gonna need some help. This Splatfest, we're gonna blur the lines between past and present, with the sounds of DJ Neu Wave and Off the Hook!*"

"*That's right, everyone! An up-and-coming DJ from West Inkopolis, DJ Neu Wave and Off the Hook are gonna bring fantastic light shows, incredible transitions, and blends of marine and human music to* all *three days of the Splatfest!*"

Lorne smiled. *You'll kill it out there, Lily. I just know it.*

"*And it's a unique show for all three nights! Each focusing on its own theme: Chaos and Order!*"

"*Pearl, that's two themes. What's the third?*"

"*Gee, I wonder! We'll leave that as a surprise for y'all on the night.*"

"*What she means is, we haven't come up with a theme for night 3.*"

"*Hush. Actually, don't, 'cause you've got some news too, right?!*"

"*YES! Because while Pearl's designing the last Shifty Station, it wouldn't* feel *like the Final Fest if we just left it at that, hm? So, I'm been working with a team of talented engineers to bring you, wait for it... Every. Single. One. EVERY Shifty Station will make a return!*"

"*That's right! For three nights only! You* really *don't want to miss this, folks!*"

Lorne smirked and mentally tuned them out as she proceeded to the kitchenette to make breakfast - stopping partway to shoot off a quick text to Lily - *Just heard the announcement on the radio. You're gonna kill it, hun.*
