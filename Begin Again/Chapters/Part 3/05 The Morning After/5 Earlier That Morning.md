Earlier that morning, somewhere far below their feet, Lily slowly stirred, lights fading on above her.

The first thoughts she had were, *sleep. I need more sleep.*

But as she thought this, she started to become aware of whatever she was wrapped in. Warm, cozy even, draped around her form. Even managed to work its way between her thighs.

For a minute or two, the fog of sleep still weighing on Lily's conscious, she took this in, simply enjoying how this felt.

But then the part of her mind meant for critical thinking began to wake, and it pointed out:

*I don't think that's a blanket.*

Indeed, thinking on it now, while it was surprisingly comfortable, it seemed... like a series of tubes wrapped around her body. Kinda like...

Lily slowly opened her eyes to take in the world around her.

Tentacles. Of course they were.

Red tentacles, suckers facing outward, gently curled around her bare skin, having supported and comforted her through the night. The tip of one was what she felt squished against her thighs and hips.

And behind/underneath her, slumbering peacefully with her pulled against him, was their owner.

DJ Octavio.

Lily closed her eyes again, the details of last night playing through her mind, and she raised a hand to her face.

*Well.*

*I don't know how I'm going to explain this.*
