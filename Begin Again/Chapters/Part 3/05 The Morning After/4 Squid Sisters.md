But they had reached out first. The Squid Sisters, in casual wear, were waiting at the inkling's door as she rounded the corner.

"You sure she's home?" Callie was in the middle of asking.

"Well, she had her team training today, right? Unless it just went for longer than normal, I have to assume-"

"I went *shopping*, ladies," Lorne sighed as she approached with her haul. She set one of the bags down and searched her pocket for her keycard. "I wasn't expecting a visit from you two today. What's up?"

Marie raised an eyebrow. "The boys said you were missing Lily, so really we should be asking *you* that..."

"Yeah, uh I... Wait, is she not doing something for you guys?" Lorne bit her lip.

"Should she be...?"

"Well it would have given some answer as to her whereabouts..." She slid the keycard over the receiver on the door, unlocking it. As the three entered into the apartment, Agent 4 explained the situation as she knew it, starting from Lily's Friday night DJ set and including what Agents 3 and 8, and Marina had told her.

"So, yeah, I know I'm being a bit paranoid, but..." Lorne sighed and glanced out the window. "But this isn't like her. In all the time she's been here..."

"She's never just gone dead quiet," Callie nodded. "I hate to say it, but... she could be in trouble."

"So she did make it out of the club?" Marie asked, with a raised eyebrow.

"Marina and Pearl saw her at the back entrance," Lorne reiterated, "but left before she did."

"Hmm. If I remember, the owner can be a bit creepy. I *doubt* he's the kind to go after inkling girls like her, but maybe I should chat with the staff there." Marie's hand lifted to her chin, thinking. "Do we know why she detoured so late at night? That's something else I think we should look at."

"Maybe..." Callie's head was down, deep in thought. "Oh! Maybe she passes through the Square! I could ask Sheldon if he's seen her that late."

"Do it." Marie nodded. "Lorne, maybe ask the other Agents if they know anything about her detours. We've certainly never known of them before. My first inclination is that this has something to do with her disappearance."

"...Okay." Lorne sucked in a breath, her eyes filling with worry. "I hope they know something. I can't believe she never mentioned it to me before."

"Me neither..." Callie bit her lip. "Well, we can only see what people know first!"

"Yeah." Marie nods again, smiling. "I hope she's okay..."
