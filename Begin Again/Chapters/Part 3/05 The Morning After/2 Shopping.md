Believing that Lily was simply celebrating the news somewhere in the city, likely with Eight, Lorne continued throughout the day, none the wiser as to the reality of her girlfriend's whereabouts.

Her first stop was a strategy meeting at Blackbelly Skatepark with her Splat Zone team. The West Inkopolis Warriors were going up against a former League team next weekend, a much more experienced team that has taken notice after their previous few successes and were interested in playing a casual game, and they had to practice and plan their attacks against this stronger team.

After hanging around at the coffee stall near the skatepark, catching up, they proceeded into it, splitting up into groups of two and trying different strategies against each other.

After the team meeting, Lorne bid them farewell later that afternoon and headed toward the apartment, stopping on the way at a MiniMakoMart to shop. Strolling the aisles, she placed a call to Eight, cradling the phone between her shoulder and head.

She didn't have to wait long for a voice to speak up on the other end. "Eight speaking."

"Hiya Eight. How're you doing?"

"I'm well, thank you. It's been a slow day here. My congratulations to Lily on the news, by the way."

"Ha, thank you. Pretty awesome, isn't it? Is she there with you, by the way?"

"Err..." There was a small pause, and Lorne frowned. "No, she isn't. I haven't seen her all day. She been away from home?"

"...Yeah, I figured she mighta been partying or something with you."

"Heh, no, sorry. She can't be far off. She's probably scheming for your anniversary."

"Oh, right, yeah I guess so. Although..." Lorne thought for a moment. It didn't quite explain something though. "I sent her a text this morning congratulating her on the announcement, but I haven't had any sort of reply since."

"Oh. Huh." The inkling could almost *hear* Eight's thinking. "Is she perhaps with Pearl and Marina already?"

"Oh, huh. Good point. Right into the studio? I could maybe see that. I'm sure she'd be eager to get straight into it."

Eight laughed. "Yeah, that sounds like her. I'm sure she's just really busy, Lorne."

"Heh, yeah, I suppose." Lorne smiled a little bit. "Alright, I'll try them then. Thanks, bud. See you soon."

"Sounds like a plan. Later, Lorne." The call disconnected, and Lorne was left to continue walking through the supermarket.
