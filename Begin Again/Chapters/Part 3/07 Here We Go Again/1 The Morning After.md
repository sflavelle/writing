## Here We Go Again

Slowly, the sun rode on another day in Inkopolis.

In an apartment near Inkopolis Square, Marie lay cozy in her bed, blanket pulled almost over her head, fast asleep.

In the other bedroom, Callie was stirring as her phone's alarm backup went off. Groggily she pulled the phone from the bedside and checked the time. It was 6:35. Her 6:30 alarm on the clock radio should have gone off. Why didn't it...?

She rolled to her other side, toward the small dresser where the clock sat.

It was switched off.

Her eyes opened fully, and she grumbled as she slowly sat herself up. Had her cousin played a prank? Did she perhaps come in and unplug the clock while she was asleep?

She scooted across the bed, leaning over the side as she felt behind the dresser for the power cable... only to find that it was still plugged in.

Oh... perhaps it finally gave up overnight. After all, it was a device she had had all throughout her childhood. She allowed herself to feel sad for it. It had been one of her first personal purchases after moving to Inkopolis, and it had been there for her even before she and Marie had properly become idols. Sure, it was just a clock, but it was still... sentimental. It had stayed with her through the changes in her life...

Having spent enough time reflecting on it, she stretched and prepared to begin her day, reaching for the lamp on the bedside and flicking it on.

Nothing happened.

*Oh.* Now Callie began to understand. There was some sort of power outage occurring. Had the landlord not paid the bill? Had Marie perhaps forgotten to pay their share? Or was there maintenance happening on their block?

She got out of bed and made her way over to Marie's bedroom. Knocking gently on the door, she heard a groan in response. "Cous'," she said gently, "the power's out."

Another groan. She heard the noises of her cousin getting out of bed and shuffling to the door, and then it opened and there was Marie, in her pyjamas. She flicked on her light switch, only for nothing to happen. "...Huh."

"Yeah. Any idea if this was planned?"

"Uhhhh..." Marie paused, mouth slightly open as her tired brain ticked over. "...No, don't think so. No notifications from the energy authority at least."

"And you sent in the utilities payment?"

"Duh. Want me to send a message to the building manager?"

"Maybe... Least it'll be a day off."

"Don't be so sure, you know they'll fix it at the last minute so you have to come in." She edged past Callie to make her way over to the bathroom. "Well, since I'm up I may as well take a shower. Let me know if you find out anything."

"'Kay, I'll go after you," Callie called after her.

Callie's laptop, sitting on the coffee table, was her next port of call. Opening it up, she grabbed her phone, flicking on the switch to create a hotspot network to work with... and noticed there was no mobile signal to connect to.

*What the heck is going on...?*

First Lily, now this. Okay yeah, this was a much lesser problem, but things just weren't -- 

Wait.

First Lily, now this ...

Callie stood, walking over to the bathroom door. "Marieee...?"

"I haven't gone down the drain yet," her cousin chuckled from the other side.

"I just had a feeling what might be going on, and I need you to convince me I'm wrong."

"Shoot."

"When... when I got squidnapped with the Great Zapfish..."

"I already don't like where this is going."

"...how... did you find out? Was it something like this?"

There was a pause from the other side of the door. Then Callie heard a sigh from her cousin. "Callie... could you head down to the street and let me know if you see the Zapfish on the Tower?"
