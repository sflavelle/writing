Pearl and Marina vainly hoped that the reason for the city-wide power outage was some other, more reasonable occurance.

But as Marina's motorcycle turned the corner, crossing the sidewalk to enter Inkopolis Square, their eyes glanced up at Deca Tower's iconic billboards, and their hearts sank.

The Square was unlit, its screens blank.

And the Great Zapfish was nowhere to be seen.

Marina cursed in Octarian.

"Fuck, *really*? This *again*?" Pearl grumbled, but her expression was grim. "The hell do we do, Marina?"

"Well, uh..." Marina was too busy working it out in her head. Once again, there was only one person she could think of that might benefit from having the Great Zapfish... "W-we could wait for someone to--"

"Pearl! Marina!"

The girls turned.

Crusty Sean, fried food purveyor, was calling them over to the front of Ammo Knights, and looked quite distressed. "What's up, yo?" Pearl asked with a raised eyebrow as the girls approached.

As they got closer, a garbage bag that had been left outside the store suddenly began to squirm, and the three of them flinched away, Pearl letting out a squeal. "The heck's in there?!"

"I dunno, but I think there's a person inside!"

"*Wwwwwwhat?!*" Marina stared at him.

"I'd cut it open, but I don't trust myself not to hurt whatever's in there!"

"Mmph! MmmmMMmmm!" came the muffled cry from the bag.

"Aight Sean, we got this." Pearl knelt down by the bag and felt for a space where she could tear the bag open.

"Hey, don't those points look like...?" started Marina.

But the question was answered for them as Pearl ripped the bag open, revealing Sheldon's face.

Marina gasped and stepped back.

"Holy cod... Hang on, crabman, we gotchu." Pearl tore the bag open as much as she could to pull Sheldon from it. He had been bound and gagged, such that he had been unable to move or speak. Who knew for how long.

"Sean, we should get him a drink." Marina glanced up at Crusty Sean. He nodded, and they both temporarily departed for his stall.

"Hold still, I'm gonna cut this stuff off." Pulling a pocket knife, she carefully made a cut in the cloth that gagged him, enough that she could grab each half and pull the cloth away. Sheldon took deep breaths once he was ungagged, and Pearl quickly cut away the rest of his bindings and helped him to a sitting position.

Sheldon himself looked like he'd had a rough night. His left cheek was bruised, and his wrists and ankles were red where he had been bound. "Haaah... Thanks. Thank you Sean, for noticing me," he smiled weakly at the shrimp as he and Marina returned.

"What the hell *happened*, Sheldon?" the octoling asked with worry as she knelt down with Pearl beside him, offering a large cup of Ink Recovery Up.

"I... don't remember yet," Sheldon said simply before taking the cup and taking large gulps. The ability was of course useless on him, but the flavor and hydration was refreshing, revitalising. "Only that I seemingly got beaten up when closing the shop last night..."

"You woke up today bound up in a garbage bag and a bruised face, Sheldon," Pearl pointed out. "I'd say that's why."

"Ah, um... yes, true." The crab blinked his eyes a few times. "You know what? I'd have surveillance footage of the incident.
