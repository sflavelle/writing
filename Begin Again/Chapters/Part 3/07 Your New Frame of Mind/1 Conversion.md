Lily struggled under the grip of the three Octolings that had her pinned to the ground. "Hey! The fuck are you doing?!"

Then DJ Octavio rose into view. He was holding something carefully in one of his tentacles. "How'd ya like my ruse, kid?!" he grinned down at her. "You've no idea how long I've been waiting for this moment!"

"What?" Lily's face frozen in fear. "What do you mean by that?! Lemme go already, damnit!"

"Please hold still." Another Octoling arrived to hold Lily's head straight, and as she stared, Octavio unfolded the object deftly and lowered it toward her face.

It was a pair of sunglasses.

A pair of sunglasses with a set of LED lights on the inside. The pattern that played in them seemed strangely hypnotic.

The glasses were slid on to Lily's head, and her struggles became frantic. "PLEASE!" she screamed as she struggled. "Stop this! You can't...!"

Pinned down, she tried her hardest to fight against her captors, trying to throw off the glasses and run, but as even more Octolings arrived to keep her on the ground, as she felt her mind become more sluggish, tired, it was seemingly impossible to fight them off.

DJ Octavio simply watched as Lily's movements gradually weakened, her will being sapped from her. Her struggles to keep his soldiers off and away from her slowed, and slowed, and slowed, as her grunts and gasps grew quieter and quieter.

He instructed the Octolings to back away once Lily's arms finally dropped down to the ground, going still and quiet. He watched for a few moments to be sure she wasn't pulling any tricks.

But Lily simply lay there. Her breathing had paused, but after nearly a minute it had resumed its natural pattern, her expression neutral under the shades as she stared upward.

"Return to your posts," Octavio directed his soldiers. "Thank you for your assistance in pacifying her. Ceph Squad, remain here." He then looked towards the inkling on the ground.

The four squad members and the King stood, watching Lily's body as her chest gently rose and fell, otherwise making no sign that she was awake or conscious. The glasses on her head pulsed in orange as it seemed to calibrate itself (and Lily). Half a minute passed as they waited for something to happen.

"...How long is this going to take, my King?" asked the squad leader as she began to pace around the body.

"Patience, Lux!" the octopus snapped. "It takes time to rewire an inkling!"

"Because this one's human?" Another squad member asked, examining them.

"It might take longer because of that, yes..." Octavio conceded with a grumble. "It took this long with Callie, and I'd know, I had to wait for her to turn enough to bust me out!"

"Wait, *CALLIE* busted you out the first ---?!"

"Shush," Lux said sharply, still watching Lily. "Something's happened."

The others could see - the pulsing on Lily's glasses had begun to rapidly flash red and orange. Though Lily continued to remain unconscious, there seemed to be an issue. Would the shades not work on her...?

"...Hmm." Octavio frowned, confused. 

"Sir...?" Lux glanced at him with an odd look. "What does that mean...?"

"I... don't know." He sighed, and began to collect her

Lily began to stir, and her arm rose to her head, as if she had a headache or her mind was fuzzy. "Urrrghhh..."

Octavio nodded to his soldiers and slithered forward on his tentacles, extending one to offer to help her up. His face changed to one of concern as her head turned toward him. "Lily! Are you alright, soldier?"

Lily seemed to blink behind her glasses. "Soldier...?" Regardless, she grabbed his tentacle, and Octavio gradually pulled her to her feet. "...Yes, I think so. Shocking headache, though... what happened...?"

Octavio and Ceph Squad grinned - it seemed the glasses were functioning fully. Lux took the question, sharing a knowing nod to the DJ as she crafted a story. "You were attacked. By one of the Squidbeak Splatoon, it seemed." She added a raised eyebrow. "We arrived in time to fend them off and get you to safety."

"They... what?" Lily looked shocked. "I thought they were my---"

"They *used* to be your friends," Octavio clarified, cutting her off. He held her chin up with a tentacle, making sure she stared right into his eyes. "I don't know what you did for them to want you dead, but it's okay. You're one of us now. We'll take you in."

"...Okay," Lily said definitively. She felt drawn to his eyes when he looked at her like that... And when she did she felt... compelled to listen to him. To trust him...

"Excellent. You're dismissed, Ceph Squad. Come by the barracks tomorrow for assignment." DJ Octavio turned, and gestured for Lily to follow. "Lily, we're headed back to my palace. I need to perform a physical inspection --- er, to make sure you're alright."

"Gross," Lux commented, but smirked. "You do you, king. We'll see you 'round." Her team saluted him, and they filed out of the passage in the opposite direction.

"...What... do they mean 'gross'?" Lily asked, raising an eyebrow as Octavio guided her back toward the palace.
