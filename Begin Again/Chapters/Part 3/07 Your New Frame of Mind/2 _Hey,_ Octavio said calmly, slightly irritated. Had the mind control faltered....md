"Hey," Octavio said quietly, calmly but with a slight twinge of irritation. *Had the mind control faltered? How odd.* "I said, 'strip'."

Without any change in expression, Lily's voice responded, "I have, sir."

"You're still wearing that glove. That needs to go too."

Lily seemed to react with some surprise to this news. As if she had completely forgotten the glove. "I'm sorry, sir, I'll remove it right away."

She took the gloved hand in her other, and slid the glove aside to join the pile of clothing.

Octavio watched intently as she finally removed the last item of clothing.

And as the greenish-blue hand slid out from inside the glove, his expression fell.

*"I'm sorry, sir. Opal Springs... has been lost."*

His mind was taken back to an incident from over a hundred years ago.

One that had resulted in the evacuation of one of the towns on the outskirts of his kingdom, and had left some of the townspeople and many of his soldiers dead.

*"The forward squad we sent to investigate the intruding excavation... We found their bodies a few hours ago."*

With scars, marks not unlike the one he saw on Lily right now.

Octavio suddenly felt rather frightened.

*Whatever it is... it's returned. And it got the human.*

*Yet she's still alive...*

"...Sit with me, Lily," he finally said, in a quiet voice. Automatically, she walked the two steps toward the bed and turned, sitting down just beside him. Draping two of his longer tentacles around her, more subdued than the frisky manner in which he had acted before, he asked of her, "Lily, where did you get this scar on your hand?"

"Commander Tartar gave it to me," she responded, glancing at him through the pulsing glasses. "For defying him."

*Tartar... She and those Squidbeak fools said he had nearly brought about the end of life on our planet. Lily had said that she met him to ask about her fate.* "Defying him...? How so?"

"He felt that I betrayed him for siding with cephalopods rather than with him, with 'humanity'." She spoke automatically, the glasses drawing the information out from the repressed depths of her mind.

"I see... Lily, have you ever been told about a settlement called Opal Springs?"

"No, sir."
