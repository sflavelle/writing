Something inside her seemed to sense that respawn point, and she felt drawn toward the grate, as shouts in Octarian erupted somewhere around her.

As she started to float in that direction though, something rushed up toward her blurry vision and a glass wall seemed to rush up in front of her, seemingly out of nowhere. She bounced harmlessly off of it, and tried to find a way around.

But she was completely surrounded.

She heard a yell of joy from one of the Octolings.

For the wall on which she had run into curved around her such that it enclosed the sides and bottom, and a cap of some kind blocked the top. The whole contraption was barely bigger than her. And what looked like a giant hand was holding tightly onto it.

If Lily's heart could sink at this moment, it would.

As she realised she had been caught. Held in a jar.

The Octarians had caught her.

*I have to get free*, she thought as she floated in the tight space. *Or my friends might never see me again.*

Lily flung herself against the lid, trying to knock it off, trying desperately to break out and escape - but it just wouldn't budge, even when she tried to run herself counterclockwise against the lid edges.

It had been fastened tightly, and it seemed to her that she would not be able to escape while she was trapped in here.

*Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck--*

The massive face of DJ Octavio loomed into view from the deep blur somewhere past the walls of her prison as whoever was carrying her brought her to him. She tensed as his tentacle latched onto the jar, and the hand that had held it relinquished its grasp. His piercing unusual eyes watched her, and as she continued to panic and try to somehow push through the glass, he seemed to be feeling a mixture of relief and sadness.

"I deeply apologise for the heavy-handedness, Lily," he said softly to the spirit in the jar. "I will explain further in due time, I promise. Your co-operation is for the betterment of both of us."

He then said something in Octarian to one of his octolings as the remaining team members gathered around her, and Lily heard a few small beeps, a code transmitted from a radio like she had done before. As the group began to chat, Lily couldn't make out anything of what they were saying now. She wondered if it was to do with her, or of something else - the way they seemed so casual now that they had defeated her.

Octavio handed back her jar to one of the Octolings - the leader, she thought, judging by the seaweed she'd seen attached to her glasses like an ornament - and the squad started to move around her as the leader slid her jar into place in their belt. She was held against the side of the octoling's hips as they all moved.

She started to struggle again to push the lid out of the way in a last-ditch effort to escape, hoping that they weren't paying as much attention anymore, but before long she felt Octavio's eyes upon her again.

"I highly recommend against doing that." He laid a tentacle tip on the lid as the spirit turned to face him again. "Much as I want to show you that things will be better with us... If you do somehow manage to escape, you've got no anchor. Spend too long in the air and you *will* expire. And I really *wouldn't* want to see that happen to you, Lily."

Lily's spirit paused, staring out at him. *Was that true? ...Do I really want to find out?*

*...No, I don't...*

The spirit floated down in defeat, and slumped at the bottom of her jar.

"Good girl. Let's go."

Then they all seemed to shift forms, and the black shorts Lily's jar was brushing against became a mass of red ink and flesh, her carrier becoming an octopus, and the light around her seemed to vanish, rushing upwards out of sight.

The Octolings were dropping into one of the kettles leading away from the Canyon.

And Lily watched through the wall of the jar as the night sky shrank away above her, as her captors fell through the pitch-black tunnels, and she got the sinking feeling she would not see the surface for a long, long time.
