The inkling gradually forced her thoughts away from the lewd activities Octavio's comments led her to think on, and shifted to more calming things. How relaxing this moment was to her. How comforting Tavi always seemed...

She felt comfortable, felt calmer. She stood up briefly, stretching her legs.

As she did so, Octavio began to speak softly to her. "Lily. If I may ask... This has been troubling me for a while. Your agent friends seem to have forgotten I'm here. *I* think I've learned my lesson. Do *you* think I've learned my lesson?"

"I... forget what you were even in there for, to be completely honest." Lily turned her head to look at him as she lifted and flexed her knees. "And it's been about a year now, right?"

"Something like that." Octavio met her gaze. "Hey, speaking of. It's been a year since you became part of our world, right? Happy anniversary."

"Thanks, Tavi." Lily smiled warmly at him. "Y'know, it's so nice that even you are celebrating me." She turned away again. "Yeah, I'd say you should be released by now. Y'know, assuming you're gonna be good and not do... whatever it was that got you locked up in here again."

"Heh. I sincerely appreciate your words, Lily. I'm more than ready to be released."

"I'm sure, just... I don't know how to do that. I guess the first step is, uh... I should probably let the NSS know that we--"

The brushing of something along her shoulder cut her off.

It was scarred, warm, fleshy, as the appendage slid along her right to her left shoulder, pulling Lily in towards the owner's body.

Finding herself face-to-face with the King.

Lily froze, falling silent as she realised just how *big* he was up close, as DJ Octavio's tentacles embraced her to him. A spicy scent filled her nostrils as she was held.

Something felt wrong. Even thought she had just said he should be freed... This put her at unease.

"Sshhhh..." One of his eight tentacles stroked over her head, leaning her gently into his. "Don't worry about them."

"H-how... did you free yourself?" Lily's breath was shallow, her movements careful. Her cheeks began to flush again. She caught a glimpse at his snowglobe - the glass dome had been easily lifted and pushed aside.

*To be able to do that so swiftly...*

"My dear, I've been able to escape for *months*." Tavi lied through his smirk, caressing her softly. "I only never left because doing so would mean not seeing you again."

"Tavi, I love you but I doubt that that's--"

"You *love* me? Did I hear that correctly~?" His smirk widened and his tentacles held her tighter.

Lily's blush deepened. She hadn't meant to phrase it *quite* like that... *Maybe more of a friend with benefits?* She didn't feel like she could quite correct herself in this situation though. "U-uhm... I uh..."

"Well, consider me flattered, my dear." Octavio's tentacles brushed over her body once more, then loosened. "Come live with me, Lily. Share my bedchambers at the Palais Takowasa and put some of that human knowledge to use with us. And between you and me..." He leaned toward her ear. "...we have a *lot* of unfulfilled promises to work out~"

Lily's cheeks burned, once again remembering all the flirting... After a moment, she pushed at him and extricated herself from his grasp. It *sounded* fun, and she wanted to see life in Octopia, but she'd established herself in Inkopolis, and she already *had* a partner, after all... "O-Octavio... I'm honored, I truly am, but I... I can't. I've got too much going for me in Inkopolis to just... drop everything." She dropped her head and sighed. "I would love to visit Octopia one day, I truly, truly would. And well, if things change there's no reason that that couldn't happen in the future... But right now... I'm... sorry, Octavio." She came back to him and gently hugged him.

"Ah..." DJ Octavio let out a deep sigh as she hugged him. He *had* expected her to back out, from all the talks that they had had - she seemed like the sort of person to back out, to need to be pushed into making a leap like that. With an odd little twirl of a tentacle, he nodded. "I cannot say I'm not disappointed... But I understand."

It hurt Lily to hurt him like this. But it just didn't feel right to just leave everything behind. She started to back away toward the grate. "L-look. I'd better get out of here... I won't say a word. You do what you need to. I'll just uh... 'discover you missing' sometime tomorrow or something. O-okay?"

As she turned to face the grate, she saw the face of someone else straightening up from behind the Squid Sisters' couch, by the lone tree in the Hideout, and walk around to block her path to the grate with their Octo Shot pointed at her. Revealing herself at Octavio's visual signal.

An Octoling. Lily frowned. *Why was she here?* She *swore* she remembered her from somewhere...

"I'm sorry, Lily," Octavio said softly behind her. "It isn't quite going to work out that way."

The sound of more rustling and footsteps behind her made her turn around again, and three other Octolings stepped out from various hiding spots. Lily quickly found herself surrounded by the Octo Shot user, a Roller, a Blaster and a Charger, as well as Octavio himself. "T-Tavi...?"

"Lily..." The great octopus sighed. "Please understand. Your friends won't just simply let me go. I'd already spent two more years in that damned prison before I was freed. I've just *spent* a third year. Do you really not think that the moment they find out I've returned home, they won't come after me *again*?"

"T-then I won't say anything. I promise. Please--"

"I'm sorry." Octavio's tentacle extended toward her. "I can't chance that. I'll have to ask you to come with us."

Lily stared at him, and fear started to settle in. She slowly turned to get a look at the other Octolings that kept her pinned in, frantically, silently trying to come up with an idea.

*Are... they're... they're about to take me away, aren't they?*

She finally turned back toward Octavio, and as he saw the look in her eyes he began to frown. "Lily, please don't do what I think you're about to do..."

Lily shook her head, only having come up with one idea. "I'm sorry, DJ. I won't go."

Then she quickly turned squid, her form rushing to the ground.

Above her, startled by the sudden movement, the Octo Shot and Charger loosed ink in her direction.

And as the Octarian ink started to fall, Lily rushed back upward - becoming an inkling again as she shoulder-bashed into the Blaster, knocking her away and getting out of the path of the Roller's ink as it flung itself in her direction.

Lily sprinted for the Cuttlefish Cabin bench, where she'd set her backpack down earlier. If she could just get it open, her Dualies were in there. She yanked the bag from its seat and pulled it along with her as she sprinted down through the archway toward the kettles, the Octarians beginning their pursuit, firing and moving quickly.

Octavio bellowed something in Octarian to his troops. Hearing the tinge of anger in his voice shook Lily - it was something she had not heard in him before. It really solidified in her the reality of what was happening.

She *needed* those dualies.

*First order of business*, Lily thought to herself as she ran. *I have to let the girls know he's free.* Her head whipped around constantly as she looked for a spot where she could take a few seconds to get a message out, knowing the Octolings were hot on her tail.

Thinking about it, running from four Octolings felt familiar to her for some reason...

She leapt down from a ledge down onto the grassy area of the Hideout and ducked behind it, slamming her bag down and yanking the zipper open. She quickly pulled out her Dualies, and the radio she had been provided long ago by Marie. She swung the bag onto her back and began to transmit a few beeps first before coming on. "Crai--"

She was knocked sideways as an Octoling boot connected with her head, and the radio was knocked out of her hand. She rolled on the ground and got up quickly, holding tight onto the single Dualie she had held onto as her Blaster assailant said something in Octarian. Lily backed away, jamming her finger on the Dualie trigger--

And noticed the Charger beam pointed at her from above--

Lily dove to the side as a loud 'crack!' sounded from the Octo Charger and a blast of pressurised ink shot in her direction. A brief glance told her she'd at least hit the Blaster octoling, but not enough to dispatch her. She knew she was outmatched.

She had to escape back to Inkopolis, *somehow*.

The Blaster drew her attention for another brief moment as she was fired upon again. Firing a few more shots toward her, Lily noticed the empty space to the left of the Charger above, a place where she could perhaps get an edge on these attackers.

The inkling charged *toward* the Blaster, making her pause for just a moment in confusion. Lily then turned squid as another Charger blast covered the ground behind her, and swam between the octoling's legs - popping up immediately after and swinging an elbow at her head, then firing her Dualie point blank into her.

The subsequent burst of her opponent gave her some ease. *Okay, this is doable. I just have to fight my way back.* She used the jet on the grip of her singular Dualie to awkwardly dash up against the wall, above which the Charger was perched. She could already hear the other three communicating between each other, quickly, angrily.

Grabbing the other Dualie from the backpack that was still discarded by the wall, she fired upon the wall itself, creating a path upwards for her. She glanced behind her at the sound of a Roller behind her, having seemed to have come down the ramp to flank her.

With a cheeky salute, Lily flung herself into the ink as she heard the Roller call out, swimming upward toward the ledge.

*This is my chance.*

But as she leapt up into the air, above the Charger, she heard a male grunt and her eyes flicked up to see saw DJ Octavio ten, perhaps fifteen meters away from them.

DJ Octavio, who had flung something large and transparent in her direction.

Time seemed to slow down for a second as she tried to parse what she was seeing.

Then the heavy glass dome from the snowglobe slammed into her in mid-air, knocking the breath out of her. Momentum carried the dome along and she was hurled backwards with it and suddenly the Charger, Octavio, and the archway leading back to Inkopolis was shrinking--

And as she and the snowglobe smashed into a wall behind her - the glass shattering into and around her - her body burst, and her vision blurred. She felt light, floating, and quite shocked.

She had been splatted and had become a spirit, seeking a respawn point.

Leaving a sky blue ink stain behind.
