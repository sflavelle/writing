## Last Night A DJ...

The air had grown colder by the time Lily had made her way to her next stop.

Leaping through the grate into the floating platform of Tentakeel Hideout, above the Octo Canyon, the inkling was carrying the backpack in which she held the old human laptop she played her mashups from. Also inside were her treasured Dualies set, a half-empty drink bottle, an iPhone 8 Plus, and the radio which connected her with the rest of the New Squidbeak Splatoon.

Lily took a moment to take in the change of environment. In an instant, the city environs had fallen away, the closed, sometimes claustrophobic spaces of the city falling away to open air. Though the Octarians formally owned this space, the area was empty, and felt devoid of people. For a moment she took comfort in the moments of solitary.

There was only a single light source here in the space, illuminating a small cabin, one that had been established at least a year ago - seemingly recent, but before her time. The only other lights belonged to the city, past the massive rocks a few kilometers away that marked the edge of the Octo Canyon, and the stars in the sky, which glimmered in the sky, even as they became less visible past the glow of Inkopolis City.

This place in particular, Tentakeel Hideout... This was the current base of operations for the New Squidbeak Splatoon.

Though nobody besides Lily had been around here for months.

She walked over to the Cuttlefish Cabin, and dropped the bag on the cabin bench, then sat down herself. There were a few moments of silence where she collected herself, letting the cool breeze wash over her, clearing her head. Without looking, she yawned, "Hello, Octavio."

"Nearly forgot about me tonight, didn't you?" replied a male, gurgly voice a few meters to her left.

"Nope. Not at all." She didn't look up to see him, but he knew he was there. "I'm just... *so* drained right now."

"Oh? The show didn't go well?"

"Heh... Quite the opposite, actually." Lily smiled, and closed her eyes for a few moments, letting them rest. "I spent so much emotional energy tonight... It was just... so, so perfect for what it was. Tavi, they're gonna let me play on the Splatfest stage in a few weeks. I finally got to tell the world today."

"Well deserved, my dear human." Octavio's voice was calm, relaxed. "Any moments in particular standing out to you?"

"Uh... a few. It's all a bit of a blur at the moment." She finally glanced up at him, and lifted herself from the bench toward his resting place. "But I think the whole club shouting the lyrics to 'Now or Never' is gonna be stuck in my brain for a while. Just... Just awesome."

"Heh. C'mere." Octavio gestured her toward him, and the inkling walked right up to his snowglobe. The two shared a 'fistbump' through the glass. "I think you'd do well in the underground, Lily."

"Yeah?" Lily shot a look at him. "From what I remember you telling me of your people, they seem quite kind."

Octavio nodded. "And loyal. The only issue with getting you there at the moment is the whole network of cities and towns and such... that'd be all unpowered."

"Why's that? What's Octopia run on?"

"Usually?" Octavio thought for a moment. "A few of your Zapfishes, to be honest. We wouldn't have any. Before you ask," he started, raising an eyebrow at her, "we *have* tried alternate energy sources. We're not deep enough underground to have access to geothermal energy, and while our nation has *some* access to coal and other resources, if I recall from our past experiments in the last hundred years the power plants we installed to process it polluted a few of our caves with horrible air."

Lily nodded. "Ours is about the same story, except a few countries stuck with it, mine included. So, Zapfishes... from the surface I assume?"

"We have no choice." Octavio waved the same tentacle at her. "You know as well as I do, it's clean, renewable energy."

"I get it. Though Inkopolis needs that energy too. Have you considered solar energy?"

"...Lily, that's the sun."

"Yes, and?"

"...We are *underground*?"

"Tavi, where are we?" Lily gestured around at the Octo Canyon around them.

"Don't you dare tell me we still own this canyon!" The DJ snapped, jabbing a tentacle toward the Cuttlefish Cabin. "What's that cabin over there then?!"

"You misunderstand me. A flat panel with a bunch of photoelectric sensors that takes in sunlight and generates a little electricity. I'm no scientist, but - developed enough, a few panels like that on someone's house can produce enough power for them to live on. Look at all the unused space here." She gestured around at the walls of the canyon, off in the distance. "I bet you could power the entire underground with a large-scale solar farm just on the walls here."

"That's if it's developed to your standard, human." Octavio rolled his eyes. "I see a flaw, however. During the night, or in bad weather here on the surface, how do you expect us to have power?!"

"Octavio..." Lily was confused and concerned. "*Surely* you guys have developed batteries."

"*Of course* we have batteries!" Octavio barked. "Those tiny little things can't hold an entire network's power system!"

"Come on, man! Take *that* technology and scale it up! Just build something to store the energy when it's not being used! Surely you can make 'that but bigger'!"

The two stared at each other for a moment, both slightly irritated, Lily beginning to feel frustrated with him. *Fuckin' Octavio, I know you're smarter than that,* she thought.

"...Hm." DJ Octavio eyed her carefully, the tinges of a frown behind his tentacle moustache. "I suppose I may have misunderstood. Then what do you propose we do for power while we built your... 'solar network'?"

"...I don't know," Lily acquiesced, sighing and looking away as she softly spoke. "It was just a thought I had had."

"I understand. I'm sorry, Lily." Octavio sighed, and a tentacle rubbed the glass between them. "I don't wish to be upset with you. Much as it's strange to admit, you're the closest thing I've had to a friend this past year."

"Aww, that warms my heart, Tavi." Lily smiled and blushed slightly at the compliment. "Is this another attempt to get me to let you out?"

"No! Not at all!" the octopus grumbled. "...Well, not this time."

Lily snorted. "Well I'm very flattered."

"Really, though... You kept coming back. You... actually *talked* to me, rather than just writing me off. Your inkling friends did just that. Much as I hate being stuck in here, I appreciate you coming back every week."

"W-wow, uh... thank you, Octavio." Lily let a slight blush of sky blue form on her cheeks.

There was a slight pause. Then Octavio decided to try his luck once more, a smirk forming. "You're about the only inkling I'd consider mating, too," he teased with a huge grin.

"Pff, you know I have a partner, right?" Lily grinned, trying to play it off, but her blush intensified.

"I'm tellin' ya. Once you try these tentacles, there's no going back, baby."

"Oh I-I'm sure." Lily's cheeks were deeply flushed now. "I'm well aware of what those tentacles are good for. I-I don't think I'm into getting intimate out here though, s-so uh, no thanks..."

"What kind of man do you take me for?" Octavio asked, still smirking. "I'd take you to my royal bedchambers, of *course*. Only the best for my mate."

"Tavi, you *must* have a lover back home." Lily began to pace aimlessly around his snowglobe, embarassed and nervous.

"None. Never. I don't need one, remember? Besides, I'm royalty. Nobody could stop me from taking after you.~" To accentuate his point he began wiggling his eyebrows at her.

"O-oh my..." Lily turned away, trying to calm her thoughts. She was somewhat ashamed to feel just how much his words were exciting her - at least, the part of her that she more or less never acted on. Octavio had noticed that the inkling's left hand had drifted near her crotch, very briefly, and grinned to himself.

She glanced back at him, a light smirk on her face. "Just know, I'm not gonna make it easy on you to win me over, Tavi."

"Woe to me," Octavio said simply, smirking back. "One day I'll have you, Lily. I owe it to us to, dear."

"H-heh... well, one day, Octavio." Lily raised an eyebrow. "Hopefully if tensions ease between our people... Even then, I have a girlfriend already, so~..."

"Pfeh. And what will you do without me in the meantime?" he asked, letting his smirk fade.

"W-well I don't know but right now I... I wanna just... be here, with you, for a bit." A slight pause. Lily's voice had become quieter. "No horniness, no bullshit, just...I just want to enjoy the night." She turned back toward him and knelt down onto the ground staring up into the night sky, partially through the octopus's snowglobe.

"...At least one of us can," Octavio snarked. He paused to think for a moment, then nodded. "Alright, dear human. Let's chill." For his part, he lowered himself down against the glass behind him, letting his tentacles relax as he adjusted himself to gaze upward. Where he noticed his appendages blocking the inkling's view, he adjusted them slightly, curling them inward.

Lily laid herself down, barely beneath the snowglobe, resting her hands beneath her head, relaxing her breathing. "Thanks..."

"You're quite welcome," came Octavio's gently spoken reply.

Lily and Octavio sat in silence as they stared up into the stars.

A few minutes passed. In the moment, the only sounds they heard were of the ocean far from them, their own breathing (her soft, light breaths and Tavi's deep, lightly-labored ones), and the breeze whistling through the trees and the floating platform.

"You must get tired of this view," Lily said quietly, watching the stars flicker above them.

"A bit," the octopus admitted. "There are worse sights I could be stuck with, though..."

"Mm..."
