Renki was the one that volunteered to do the actual introduction of Cephalon City, with the rest acting as bodyguards.

As they guided Lily out of the Cephalon HQ compound to introduce her to Octarian society, she noticed that Renki was open to answering most questions she had about the different ways in which things worked down here.

The tour of Cephalon City took her out the front gates of the HQ, down the main street towards the circular Cephalon Central Transit Hub, where Lily marveled at the amount of Octarians that travelled through the building, even simply from kettle to kettle. Its layout was very straightforward, she realised - Renki explained that where possible, the building acted as a compass. If you wanted to head toward the northern settlements, you'd take the kettles to the north of the building.

"Clever," Lily admitted. "Was the transit network built out like that from the beginning, or did it come later?"

"The Palais would *love* to tell the inklings it was part of their grand design from the beginning," Renki grinned. "It came as a kind of necessity after settlements spread further and further out. It'd be counter-intuitive to have to go through a western kettle to get to a north-east point."

"Niiice." Lily looked around once more from behind her guard, and whistled. "That's some smart planning there, I'm actually quite impressed."

"Y'won't get *that* from the inklings," Mori snarked.

"So wait, where does the surface kettles come in?"

"Well, you could *kinda* say the Octo Valley and Canyon are like... communities, of a sort?" Renki thought aloud. "The places that hook up to those areas all help each other out, with supplies, people, that kind of thing."

"Huh." Lily nodded, thinking on it. "So is Tentakeel a real place, then?"

"Of course," Lux hmmphed. "You just don't see Octarians use the Hideout anymore because your superiors set up shop there."

"...fair."

After that, she was led down another street as Renki again introduced her to the business available in Cephalon City, including - Lily took a double take at this - a public baths.

"Y'all are comfortable with all that down here?" Lily asked, eyes wide and gesturing back at the sign that Renki had translated for her.

"Why not?" Renki said with a shrug.

Kae smirked. "Thought you'd be more comfortable with that, seeing as-"

"Kae." Lux called sharply.

"Alright, *fiiine*." Kae made a motion of zipping her mouth shut. "All I'll say is, we're a lot more open and casual about our bodies than what you're probably used to above ground."

"So I've heard. Tavi made a big deal about people not making a fuss abou--"

"*Tavi?*" The squad stopped, and Lily bumped into Renki. She turned to face Mori, who continued, "Did I hear that right? You have a *pet name* for him?"

"Uh. More of a nickname--"

"Lady, I don't *care* what you think it is. Damn, he got you down *bad* for him." Mori laughed out loud.

Lily's brows slowly furrowed as she stared at her. "I. What does it matter?"

----

Walking down from the cliff face that Renki had guided her up, a lookout at the side of the massive cave that hosted the city, Lily noticed Lux raising a hand to cover one of her ears for a moment, listening to something. Then, as the group reached the street again, the leader called them to a halt, turning to Lily. "Alright, human. Renki's been doing a fine job introducing you, but we have orders to return you to the king, via the barracks."

"Why the barracks?"

"Why do you need to know?"

As they headed back toward the HQ compound, Lily couldn't pick out any emotion from the squad surrounding her. She *thought* she might have seen the glimpses of a frown on Renki's face, but then again, she was bad at reading body language, and after all these four were here to stop her from leaving...

As they stepped into the HQ walls once again, Lily noted that the area around the respawning pool had been cleaned up. She bit her lip, looking away.

"Probably should stop throwing up our ink," Mori commented, noticing the motion.

"I'll be sure to as soon as I can stomach it."

The place seemed calmer, quieter than before, as the team communicated between themselves in Octarian. Not as quiet as the night before, but there were much less people around than there had been that morning.

She realised why as they passed the gaol building and she was unexpectedly tackled to the ground by several Octolings, lying in wait for them.

Lily struggled under the grip of the three Octolings that had her pinned to the ground. "Hey! The fuck are you doing?!"

Then DJ Octavio rose into view. He was holding something carefully in one of his tentacles. "How'd ya like my ruse, kid?!" he grinned down at her. "You've no idea how long I've been waiting for this moment!"

"What?" Lily's face frozen in fear. "What do you mean by that?! Lemme go already, damnit!"

"Please hold still." Another Octoling arrived to hold Lily's head straight, and as she stared, Octavio unfolded the object deftly and lowered it toward her face.

It was a pair of sunglasses.

A pair of sunglasses with a set of LED lights on the inside. The pattern that played in them seemed strangely hypnotic.

The glasses were slid on to Lily's head, and her struggles became frantic. "PLEASE!" she screamed as she struggled. "Stop this! You can't...!"

Pinned down, she tried her hardest to fight against her captors, trying to throw off the glasses and run, but as even more Octolings arrived to keep her on the ground, as she felt her mind become more sluggish, tired, it was seemingly impossible to fight them off.

DJ Octavio simply watched as Lily's movements gradually weakened, her will being sapped from her. Her struggles to keep his soldiers off and away from her slowed, and slowed, and slowed, as her grunts and gasps grew quieter and quieter.

He instructed the Octolings to back away once Lily's arms finally dropped down to the ground, going still and quiet. He watched for a few moments to be sure she wasn't pulling any tricks.

But Lily simply lay there. Her breathing had paused, but after nearly a minute it had resumed its natural pattern, her expression neutral under the shades as she stared upward.

"Return to your posts," Octavio directed his soldiers. "Thank you for your assistance in pacifying her. Ceph Squad, remain here." He then looked towards the inkling on the ground.

The four squad members and the King stood, watching Lily's body as her chest gently rose and fell, otherwise making no sign that she was awake or conscious. The glasses on her head pulsed in orange as it seemed to calibrate itself (and Lily). Half a minute passed as they waited for something to happen.

"...How long is this going to take, my King?" asked the squad leader as she began to pace around the body.

"Patience, Lux!" the octopus snapped. "It takes time to rewire an inkling!"

"Because this one's human?" Another squad member asked, examining them.

"It might take longer because of that, yes..." Octavio conceded with a grumble. "It took this long with Callie, and I'd know, I had to wait for her to turn enough to bust me out!"

"Wait, *CALLIE* busted you out the first ---?!"

"Shush," Lux said sharply, still watching Lily. "Something's happened."

The others could see - the pulsing on Lily's glasses had shifted to slowly blink a solid green for a few seconds, before shifting to its normal pattern.

Octavio sighed in relief. "Good, they work..."

"...Were you expecting them not to?" Mori raised an eyebrow toward him.

"Well, you know, her human mind and such..." He waved her off with a tentacle. "Thought I would have to go back to Arthra and recalibrate them for her specifically."

"I think he would've been keeping up with the news," Lux nodded. "You'd be surprised just how much info there is on her if you know where to look."

A noise from Lily at that moment shut them up.

The inkling began to stir, and her arm rose to her head, as if she had a headache or her mind was fuzzy. "Urrrghhh..."

Octavio nodded to his soldiers and slithered forward on his tentacles, extending one to offer to help her up. His face changed to one of concern as her head turned toward him. "Lily! Are you alright, soldier?"

Lily seemed to blink behind her glasses. "Soldier...?" Regardless, she grabbed his tentacle, and Octavio gradually pulled her to her feet. "...Yes, I think so. Shocking headache, though... what happened...?"

Octavio and Ceph Squad grinned - it seemed the glasses were functioning fully. Lux took the question, sharing a knowing nod to the DJ as she crafted a story. "You were attacked. By one of the Squidbeak Splatoon, it seemed." She added a raised eyebrow. "We arrived in time to fend them off and get you to safety."

"They... what?" Lily looked shocked. "I thought they were my---"

"They *used* to be your friends," Octavio clarified, cutting her off. He held her chin up with a tentacle, making sure she stared right into his eyes. "I don't know what you did for them to want you dead, but it's okay. You're one of us now. We'll take you in."

"...Okay," Lily said definitively. She felt drawn to his eyes when he looked at her like that... And when she did she felt... compelled to listen to him. To trust him...

"Excellent. Come with me." DJ Octavio turned, and gestured for Lily to follow. "I need to fit you for a new uniform. Then I have a task for the five of you..."
