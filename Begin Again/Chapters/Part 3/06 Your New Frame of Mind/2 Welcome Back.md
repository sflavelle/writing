The Octarian crowd gathering in the Cephalon HQ, before the steps to the Palais Takowasa, murmured in excitement as they awaited the public arrival of their king.

"Finally!" One octoling exclaimed.

"Surely he'll fix this terrorism problem!" hoped another.

"I'm just happy to see him again!" responded a Tentakook.

Yes, it seemed they already knew. Then again, royal news got around quickly. *DJ Octavio had returned.*

Last many of them knew, he had been defeated and captured by those dastardly New Squidbeak Splatoon agents. Which was a shame - Callie had been *such* a refreshing addition to Octopia while she had been around...

Which begged the question - had Octavio brought someone to the underground with him again?

Hopefully they wouldn't have to wait long to find out.

A few minutes of excited chatter later, the populace got their answer, as the doors to the palace opened and a complement of guards filtered out, trailed by DJ Octavio himself... and a rather normal looking inkling?

Amongst the cheers for their king, there were murmurs. Surely they had to be influential in some way, right? Octavio wouldn't just kidnap some random inkling off the street?

Near the edge of the crowd, as the King began his speech, a male Octoling discreetly pressed a small button on the arm of his glasses...

"Okay, we have signal-"

"The rumors are true, he's returned to-"

In a secluded, lit cave somewhere in Octopia, a team of Octolings burst into action.

Among them, their leader, a female Octoling with purple tentacles, watched the camera feed broadcasted to them by their agent in the crowd.

They knew this day would come eventually, the return of Octavio. They would have to be careful now, but their mission would not change.

In fact, now it was more important than ever.

Her gaze focused briefly on the inkling up on the stairs with Octavio, looking awkwardly around at the crowd staring daggers at her. Who was this? "Can we get an ident on the inkling? Looks like another hostage."
