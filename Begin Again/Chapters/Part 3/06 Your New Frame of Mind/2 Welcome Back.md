The Octarian crowd gathering in the Cephalon HQ, before the steps to the Palais Takowasa, murmured in excitement as they awaited the public arrival of their king.

"Okay, we have signal-"

"The rumors are true, he's returned to-"

"Is that an inkling? Can you zoom in on-"

In a secluded, lit cave somewhere in Octopia, a team of Octolings burst into action.

Among them, their leader, a female Octoling with purple tentacles, watched the camera feed broadcasted to them by their agent in the crowd.

They knew this day would come eventually, the return of Octavio. They would have to be careful now, but their mission would not change.

In fact, now it was more important than ever.

Her gaze focused briefly on the inkling up on the stairs with Octavio, looking awkwardly around at the crowd staring daggers at her. Who was this? "Can we get an ident on the inkling? Looks like another hostage."
