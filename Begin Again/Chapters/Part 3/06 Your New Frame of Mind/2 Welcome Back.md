The Octarian crowd gathering in the Cephalon HQ, before the steps to the Palais Takowasa, murmured in excitement as they awaited the public arrival of their king.

"Finally!" One octoling exclaimed.

"Surely he'll fix this terrorism problem!" hoped another.

"I'm just happy to see him again!" responded a Tentakook.

Yes, it seemed they already knew. Then again, royal news got around quickly. *DJ Octavio had returned.*

Last many of them knew, he had been defeated and captured by those dastardly New Squidbeak Splatoon agents. Which was a shame - Callie had been *such* a refreshing addition to Octopia while she had been around...

Which begged the question - had Octavio brought someone to the underground with him again?

Hopefully they wouldn't have to wait long to find out.

A few minutes of excited chatter later, the populace got their answer, as the doors to the palace opened and a complement of guards filtered out, trailed by DJ Octavio himself... and a rather normal looking inkling?

Amongst the cheers for their king, there were murmurs. Surely they had to be influential in some way, right? Octavio wouldn't just kidnap some random inkling off the street?

Near the edge of the crowd, as the King began his speech, a male Octoling discreetly pressed a small button on the arm of his glasses...

"Okay, we have signal-"

"The rumors are true, he's returned to-"

In a secluded, lit cave somewhere in Octopia, a screen blinked to life, and a team of Octolings burst into action.

Among them, their leader, a female Octoling with purple tentacles, watched the camera feed broadcasted to them by their agent in the crowd.

They knew this day would come eventually, the return of Octavio. They would have to be careful now, but their mission would not change.

In fact, now it was more important than ever.

Her gaze focused briefly on the inkling up on the stairs with Octavio, looking awkwardly around at the crowd staring daggers at her. Who was this? "Can we get an ident on the inkling?"

"Working on it," called a octoling male in front of another screen. After a few moments of frantic typing, he had a profile up. "Got it. Lily Sunden, NSS Agent 5, ex-human. Getting a printout."

"That was fast," she replied. "Have they still not upgraded their security at CI?"

"Not at all," was the male's reply, chuckling.

*The human?* The leader thought. Now that *would* be a high profile captive for the king.

The existence of a former human had been one of the worst kept secrets in Central Intelligence. It was all she had heard when Lily had first appeared. Though there'd been less talk over the last year, every now and then she'd hear updates on her movements - activity near a deactivated weapon in the ocean; a date with her partner, Agent 4, in Inkopolis; DJing in a local club; and checking in on the King in his captivity.

*Guess he finally got to her.*

She watched as Octavio introduced Lily to the audience, touting her as a gateway to the technologies of prior civilizations... as well as some less flattering words that she couldn't understand.

Interestingly, it seemed she was still herself. But knowing Octavio, the resistance leader was willing to believe that would not stay for long.

A print-out of Lily's CI profile was presented to her, and she took it. As she listened to Octavio's speech, she took a seat at her station and began to read.

"...and will help us to resolve our ongoing power woes!" the King called, to a cheer from the crowd.

"I ask you to help her 'acclimate' to our society, and show her the ways of the Octarians!" Another cheer.

"And in the meantime, be ready! Octopia needs your help now more than ever! For together, we will prevail!" The biggest cheer yet. Octavio smirked, projecting his air of confidence and authority. After a few more moments of soaking in the crowd, he turned to re-enter the palace, his speech over. As he did, he turned to Lily. "I think that went well," he said in her language.

"It uh... sounded like it?" Lily chuckled, still nervous at all the Octarians staring at her.

Tavi laughed. "Don't worry, we'll get you educated in our language. Anyway, I welcome you to explore Cephalon City. Lux, Ceph Squad, get over here." He gestured the Octoling guards over, whom Lily quickly recognised as those from the previous night. "You'll be escorting her today." Then he said something else in Octarian, and Lily rolled her eyes.

There were noises of what sounded like affirmation from the Octolings. "Are we really gonna have to be bodyguards for this one?" Complained the leader afterward in Inklish, gesturing at Lily. "We're an offensive squadron, not babysitters."

"Just for the day," Octavio sighed, rolling his eyes. "Besides, Lily can't be *that* hard to deal with. Just remember to keep your gun loaded," he added with a chuckle.

"*That* was a minor tactical error in an unusual situation," Lux grumped.
