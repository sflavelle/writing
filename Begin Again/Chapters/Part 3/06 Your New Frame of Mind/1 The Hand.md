## Your New Frame of Mind

The royal bathrooms of DJ Octavio Takowasa were as luxurious and well, 'royal' as the bedroom. 

This was the first thought that Lily had as she entered the room to look herself over.

She had managed to gently, carefully extract herself from the King's tentacles to tiptoe in the darkness over to this adjoining room once she had awoken. Lily wasn't *entirely* sure that he was still slumbering, but as is right now, she felt... gross and just needed to clean herself up.

Lily hoped Octavio wouldn't mind.

Looking herself over in a full-length mirror, she ran her hands over her front, brushing her fingers over various sucker marks, aches and pains, and a slight firmness in her lower belly that she wasn't sure was her diet.

*Man, he really did a number on me.*

She glanced down at her right hand, and was surprised to find it ungloved. She realised the must have been too lost in... the moment, to notice that it had been removed with the rest of her clothes. The splotchy green mark, a terrible memory of her past mission, began to throb mildly with pain, as if her noticing its existence had reminded it to do so.

The mark was looking a bit worse for wear this morning, or... whenever it actually was. It could do with a good clean, she decided.

She sighed, turning toward the open shower to one corner of the room. 

... yeah, alright.

Lily didn't hear or see the door open while she was busy scrubbing her body clean, in the steam and the noise of the shower.

The first indication that someone had entered the bathroom was a single tentacle reaching in, to gently brush over her body. She stiffened and snapped toward the intruder, only to notice the vague shape of her captive and companion behind the mist. "Oh. Morning."

"Good morning, my dear," came Octavio's voice from the other side of the steam cloud. "Sleep well?"

"... considering the circumstances, I suppose."

"Aw, are you still on about that?"

"Huh?" Lily took a second to think on what she said, and realised he was probably referring to her kidnapping. Which... "Oh, well yes, but I mean, we were at it for a good while there. These marks aren't coming off."

A chuckle came from behind the shower mist. "They're not meant to, dear."

"...what, seriously?"

"No, I kid. Like anything else, they should came with time. Mind if I join you? I ought to clean myself up as well."
