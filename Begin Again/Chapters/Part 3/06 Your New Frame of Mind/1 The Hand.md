## Your New Frame of Mind

The royal bathrooms of DJ Octavio Takowasa were as luxurious and well, 'royal' as the bedroom. 

This was the first thought that Lily had as she entered the room to look herself over.

She had managed to gently, carefully extract herself from the King's tentacles to tiptoe in the darkness over to this adjoining room once she had awoken. Lily wasn't *entirely* sure that he was still slumbering, but as is right now, she felt... gross and just needed to clean herself up.

Lily hoped Octavio wouldn't mind.

Looking herself over in a full-length mirror, she ran her hands over her front, brushing her fingers over various sucker marks, aches and pains, and a slight firmness in her lower belly that she wasn't sure was her diet.

*Man, he really did a number on me.*

She glanced down at her right hand, and was surprised to find it ungloved. She realised the must have been too lost in... the moment, to notice that it had been removed with the rest of her clothes. The splotchy green mark, a terrible memory of her past mission, began to throb mildly with pain, as if her noticing its existence had reminded it to do so.

The mark was looking a bit worse for wear this morning, or... whenever it actually was. It could do with a good clean, she decided.

She sighed, turning toward the open shower to one corner of the room.

*... yeah, alright.*

----

Lily didn't hear or see the door open while she was busy scrubbing her body clean, in the steam and the noise of the shower.

The first indication that someone had entered the bathroom was a single tentacle reaching in, to gently brush over her body. She stiffened and snapped toward the intruder, only to notice the vague shape of her captor and companion behind the mist. "Oh. Morning."

"Good morning, my dear," came Octavio's gurgly voice from the other side of the steam cloud. "Sleep well?"

"... considering the circumstances, I suppose."

"Aw, are you still on about that?"

"Huh?" Lily took a second to think on what she said, and realised he was probably referring to her kidnapping. Which... "Oh, well yes, but I mean, we were at it for a good while there. These marks aren't coming off."

A chuckle came from behind the shower mist. "They're not meant to, dear."

"...what, seriously?"

"No, I kid. Like anything else, they should fade with time. Mind if I join you? I ought to clean myself up as well."

Lily gave it a moment's thought. "I guess I don't mind, no."

Octavio's body slid in from the mist, to rest beneath the large showerhead. The inkling moved to give him some room, gesturing upward with a finger. "No funny business. I don't know how often you indulge, but I know I'll never keep up."

"Ha, don't you worry, dear," the octopus crooned, reaching an arm around her, also reaching for a soap dispenser on a small shelf on the shower wall and beginning to lather himself up. "Today is business. Addressing the populace, getting on top of things again. And, hopefully, finding somewhere for you to stay, a role for you while you're staying with us."

"A role?" Lily raised an eyebrow at him, as she started to also soap up her tentacles. "You have plans for me then."

"I'd had a thought," Octavio replied, his eyes closing as his appendages worked on clearing up the dry slime and dust coating him, from so long in captivity. Even after showering the previous night as well, he still felt grimy and unclean. "After our power discussion. Seems you've thought a bit about bridging the gap between our civilizations. And I daresay, from my time having known you, that you have a unique ability to look for the best in everyone. Even me, whom your friends in the NSS have written off."

He paused to focus, and Lily waited for him to finish. "I genuinely think that you *might* just be able to negotiate between our two races. Things like power, but also just... access to the surface."

"Seriously?" The eyebrow raised again, a bit higher this time. "I mean, I'm not sure how much help I'll end up being, but... you do realise that almost certainly, if we went to any kind of negotiations, they'll absolutely want your military dismantled, or at minimum, not pointed at *them*."

"Mmmm." A noncommittal noise from the octopus. "It's a thought in progress. The Great Turf War is way too ingrained in our culture for something like that to happen overnight."

"Well, maybe it's time to take those first steps," Lily offered, moving closer, but mostly to wash the soap from her body. The sucker marks had begun to recede from an angry red, proving they would just come off in with time. "You're right, societal change won't happen in a day, but there's still smaller actions you can take, symbolic gestures. You'll have to acclimate your people to the idea of a future where they won't *have* to fight. And acclimate *us* to the idea that you *can* negotiate without kidnapping or snatching power."

"Hmm... it'll be hard."

"Of course. But I think only one person here can make that decision. And that's you."

Octavio paused, and fixed his gaze on her. Gears were turning in his head. "...I'll see what I can do," he offered.

"Good man. I'm proud of you." Lily smiled, a genuine one.

(In reality, Octavio had to lie to her. She was optimistic of him, and he liked some of the ideas she had, but it was far too late to change his path. The Octopia power situation was dire, and needed fixing near immediately, but he knew that a request to the surface for support would ultimately mean having to give up, well, *everything* about Octopia's identity. No, in this case it was easier for him to beg forgiveness than ask permission.)

(He wasn't lying about his belief in Lily to mediate between him and the Inklings, though. Her interactions with and around him up at Tentakeel Hideout were testament to her ability to simply see the best of people.)

----

The shower passed without further incident, but it was as Lily brushed her teeth by the mirror that Octavio, drying himself off with a massive plush towel, caught a glimpse of a mark on Lily. The conversation they were having had suddenly died.

"...Tavi? All good?" Lily had lifted her gaze and turned toward him, her right hand hanging limp with toothbrush in its grip.

The DJ's wide gaze was fixed on said hand.

Lily's right hand sported a sickly green mark, like a burn, covering most of the skin of her hand.

The same sickly green as...

*The settlement was a horror scene.*

*As he was led through the scene by the commander on duty, the slain bodies littered the streets in every which direction he looked.*

*All with the same marks.*

*Some had had holes seemingly drilled into their temples. Some through tentacles, others missing a whole portion of their stomach.*

*But in whichever gruesome these citizens and soldiers were murdered, they all bore the same sickly green splotch around the wound. A mix of cyan and yellow... ink?*

*The sight was sickening. How could this have happened to Opal Springs?*

*Though he was sure of the answer, he asked the commander anyway. "Are there any survivors?"*

*"Nobody, General. We've searched the entire settlement and... it seems Opal Springs has been wiped out."*

*"But how...? Who...?"*

"Tavi...?"

*"We've no leads yet on the aggressor. But we did find something..."*

*Then General Octavio had been led to the rear of the cave pocket where Opal Springs resided, to the blown out hole in the wall.*

*"We found this intrusion where the attackers most likely came from. It's not in any of our systems. But take a look..."*

*The hole, Octavio saw, led to some sort of concrete tunnel. It was not very deep, but instead seemed to lead off to the sides into the darkness. What kind of structure was this?*

"Octavio? Can you hear me...?"

*Then he saw the body.*

*He made his way forward, toward the entry point. Climbing the rubble on his tentacles.*

*What he found was the recon squad that had been sent in to gather information on the space that had opened up.*

*And these Octolings had fared much worse.*

*Lifeless, discolored eyes stared up at him from pale, green skin.*

*Suddenly one was reaching out at him--*

"GAH!" Octavio flinched and recoiled, shocked out of his trance as Lily's arm reached out and brushed against him. Her right arm, with the stained hand, was covering her chest.

"I'm sorry!" Lily whimpered. "You weren't responsive, I thought something had... had happened."

The octopus's eyes were still whipping back and forth as he tried to get his breath under control. It... it had been a *long* time since he'd had that nightmare.

For the first time in a *very, very* long time... he felt fear.

Whatever had wiped out Opal Springs all those years ago...

It was still alive.

It had gotten to the human.

And yet...

Slowly, his eyes refocused on Lily, and again drifted down to her hand. She seemed to notice, and turned such that it was out of his view. "S-sorry," she said. "I know it's hideous. There's a reason I wear that glove all the time."

"...You're alive." Octavio's eyes flicked up to her face.

"Uh... what?"

"...Lily, I apologise. Just, I..." He paused, unable to come up with the words. "...How... did you get that scar?"

Lily looked away, and took a moment to respond. "...I... don't actually know the full details."

"What? How's that?"

"...Well, a bit of my memory is just... gone. What I do know is, it happened when I went out to Triggerfish Forest last year, y'know, all that business around Commander Tartar?"

Octavio's eyes snapped up. *Commander Tartar*...

He was, according to the New Squidbeak Splatoon on the surface, an AI created by humanity before their demise. He had at one point threatened the lives of those on the surface, and they seemed convinced that whatever world-ending weapon he had would affect those in his underground society...

"You said you had met him, right?" Octavio asked quietly.

Lily nodded.

"Did he give that to you?"

Lily thought, then raised her hands in an 'I don't know' gesture. "My friends say he did... That's all I know."

*That's all she knows...*

*So whatever this Tartar did to her must have scrambled her memory of that event.*

"...Lily, do you know anything about a settlement called Opal Springs?" DJ Octavio had stopped shivering, but still looked fearful. 

"Um... Enlighten me."

"Okay. We should... take this back to the bedroom. This seems like the wrong place to discuss such matters."

Lily noted as they exited the bathroom that her clothes had reappeared, neatly folded in a chair near the doorway. "Ah, laundry service has been," Octavio commented. "Go ahead, my dear."

As she began to dress, DJ Octavio began to talk, watching her but gradually seeming to zone out, her eyes looking past her into space. "Opal Springs was one of our oldest settlements after the war, on the outer edges of our civilization. So named for the plentiful opal veins and fresh mineral water pockets that it was famous for. The Octarians used that opal as jewellery, in their houses, in weapons. It... was a small settlement, but a fairly opulent one, forgive the pun."

"Well, the settlement lasted for about twenty years. Twenty two, I believe. And then..."

Octavio took a breath. "One day, a 'Kook arrives at the palace. We didn't have our transport network then, so this messenger navigated from the outer reaches of Octopia to reach us. And he says the settlement is under attack. We organise a small detachment from a nearby pocket to engage the attackers, thinking it's just some stupid inklings trying to start trouble. And then a few Octocommanders, Octolings, and I march from the capitol in defense of our land."

Lily pulled her hoodie on, now fully clothed, and lowered herself to the floor, sitting cross-legged before Tavi as he told his tale.

"When we arrive... the battle is already over. The attackers are gone. But every single living resident of Opal Springs, plus the detachment we sent, are slain."

"Oh, fuck," Lily mouthed. "Octavio, I'm so sorry. That sounds horrifying."

Octavio nodded. "There's a hole in the back of the settlement where the attackers made their entry. A Commander sends a recon team in straight away while we investigate the bodies."

He took a deep breath. "Lily, no matter how each individual was murdered, each of them had the same green mark around their wound. ...I still clearly remember it. It's the same kind of mark as the one on your hand."

Lily's eyes widened. Octavio watched her as she glanced down at her right hand, her brows furrowing. When she looked back up at him, there was a question in her eyes.

The same question Octavio himself had, he felt. *Was Commander Tartar, who had laid his mark on Lily just last year, the same being behind the attack on Opal Springs seventy-nine years ago?*

There was a tap on the door. Octavio sighed. "Enter," he called in Octarian.

The door edged open, and one of his Octarian Palais guards poked its head in. "Good morning, sire. People are beginning to gather at the palace steps. I believe word has spread of your return, and the public are hoping to hear from you."

"I plan on it. We'll be out shortly."

"'We'?" The guard shot a glare at the inkling, who glanced between them, unable to understand the language.

"This is the human from the past, of course I'll introduce her," Octavio replied. "The public should be aware of her, if we don't any unforeseen accidents to befall her."

"...Very well, sire. I take me leave." The Octarian nodded toward the King, and he bowed out of the room.

Octavio sighed. "...Sorry about that, Lily," he said, switching back to her language. "Seems people are already aware we're here. I think we should go greet them."

"'We'?" Lily cocked her head to the side. "Are you sure that's wise?"

"Well, I wasn't exactly planning on having you stay in the Palais for all time." The octopus chuckled. Then his expression shifted back to the slightly vacant one he had had while talking about Opal Springs. "But I hope you understand... this revelation... even if Tartar is deceased, I can't help but wonder just what he's been up to for all of these years. I will... get my people to look into things. Perhaps we can learn more about what this affliction actually is."

Lily nodded, then suddenly her expression dropped. "...I'm not going to die from this, do you think?"

Octavio frowned and thought... then shook his head. "If this caused death, dear, it would have taken you much earlier. I think you'll be fine."

With that, he lifted himself onto his tentacles. "Now then, let's go meet our people."
