## Your New Frame of Mind

The royal bathrooms of DJ Octavio Takowasa were as luxurious and well, 'royal' as the bedroom. 

This was the first thought that Lily had as she entered the room to look herself over.

She had managed to gently, carefully extract herself from the King's tentacles to tiptoe in the darkness over to this adjoining room once she had awoken. Lily wasn't *entirely* sure that he was still slumbering, but as is right now, she felt... gross and just needed to clean herself up.

Lily hoped Octavio wouldn't mind.

Looking herself over in a full-length mirror, she ran her hands over her front, brushing her fingers over various sucker marks, aches and pains, and a slight firmness in her lower belly that she wasn't sure was her diet.

*Man, he really did a number on me.*

She glanced down at her right hand, and was surprised to find it ungloved. She realised the must have been too lost in... the moment, to notice that it had been removed with the rest of her clothes. The splotchy green mark, a terrible memory of her past mission, began to throb mildly with pain, as if her noticing its existence had reminded it to do so.

The mark was looking a bit worse for wear this morning, or... whenever it actually was. It could do with a good clean, she decided.

She sighed, turning toward the open shower to one corner of the room. 

*... yeah, alright.*

----

Lily didn't hear or see the door open while she was busy scrubbing her body clean, in the steam and the noise of the shower.

The first indication that someone had entered the bathroom was a single tentacle reaching in, to gently brush over her body. She stiffened and snapped toward the intruder, only to notice the vague shape of her captive and companion behind the mist. "Oh. Morning."

"Good morning, my dear," came Octavio's gurgly voice from the other side of the steam cloud. "Sleep well?"

"... considering the circumstances, I suppose."

"Aw, are you still on about that?"

"Huh?" Lily took a second to think on what she said, and realised he was probably referring to her kidnapping. Which... "Oh, well yes, but I mean, we were at it for a good while there. These marks aren't coming off."

A chuckle came from behind the shower mist. "They're not meant to, dear."

"...what, seriously?"

"No, I kid. Like anything else, they should came with time. Mind if I join you? I ought to clean myself up as well."

Lily gave it a moment's thought. "I guess I don't mind, no."

Octavio's body slid in from the mist, to rest beneath the large showerhead. The inkling moved to give him some room, gesturing upward with a finger. "No funny business. I don't know how often you indulge, but I know I'll never keep up."

"Ha, don't you worry, dear," the octopus crooned, reaching an arm around her, also reaching for a soap dispenser on a small shelf on the shower wall and beginning to lather himself up. "Today is business. Addressing the populace, getting on top of things again. And, hopefully, finding somewhere for you to stay, a role for you while you're staying with us."

"A role?" Lily raised an eyebrow at him, as she started to also soap up her tentacles. "You have plans for me then."

"I'd had a thought," Octavio replied, his eyes closing as his appendages worked on clearing up the dry slime and dust coating him, from so long in captivity. Even after showering the previous night as well, he still felt grimy and unclean. "After our power discussion. Seems you've thought a bit about bridging the gap between our civilizations. And I daresay, from my time having known you, that you have a unique ability to look for the best in everyone. Even me, whom your friends in the NSS have written off."

He paused to focus, and Lily waited for him to finish. "I genuinely think that you *might* just be able to negotiate between our two races. Things like power, but also just... access to the surface."

"Seriously?" The eyebrow raised again, a bit higher this time. "I mean, I'm not sure how much help I'll end up being, but... you do realise that almost certainly, if we went to any kind of negotiations, they'll absolutely want your military dismantled, or at minimum, not pointed at *them*."

"Mmmm." A noncommittal noise from the octopus. "It's a thought in progress. The Great Turf War is way too ingrained in our culture for something like that to happen overnight."

"Well, maybe it's time to take those first steps," Lily offered, moving closer, but mostly to wash the soap from her body. The sucker marks had begun to recede from an angry red, proving they would just come off with time. "You're right, societal change won't happen in a day, but there's still smaller actions you can take, symbolic gestures. You'll have to acclimate your people to the idea of a future where they won't *have* to fight. And acclimate *us* to the idea that you *can* negotiate without kidnapping or snatching power."

"Hmm... it'll be hard."

"Of course. But I think only one person here can make that decision. And that's you."

Octavio paused, and fixed his gaze on her. Gears were turning in his head. "...I'll see what I can do," he offered.

"Good man. I'm proud of you." Lily smiled, a genuine one. 

(In reality, Octavio had to lie to her. She was optimistic, and he liked some of the ideas she had, but it was far too late to change his path. The Octopia power situation was dire, and needed fixing near immediately, but he knew that a request to the surface for support would ultimately mean having to give up, well, *everything* about Octopia's identity. No, in this case it was easier for him to beg forgiveness.)

(He wasn't lying about his belief in Lily to mediate between him and the Inklings, though. Her interactions with and around him up at Tentakeel Hideout were testament to her ability to simply see the best of people.)

"Thank you, dear." DJ Octavio's expression relaxed further. Lily thought he might be smiling behind his little 'moustache'. "Now, I will be giving a speech to the people, to boost morale and I would appreciate if you would be present."
