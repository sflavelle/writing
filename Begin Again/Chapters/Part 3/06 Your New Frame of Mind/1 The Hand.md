## Your New Frame of Mind

The royal bathrooms of DJ Octavio Takowasa were as luxurious and well, 'royal' as the bedroom. 

This was the first thought that Lily had as she entered the room to look herself over.

She had managed to gently, carefully extract herself from the King's tentacles to tiptoe in the darkness over to this adjoining room once she had awoken. Lily wasn't *entirely* sure that he was still slumbering, but as is right now, she felt... gross and just needed to clean herself up.

Lily hoped Octavio wouldn't mind.

Looking herself over in a full-length mirror, she ran her hands over her front, brushing her fingers over various sucker marks, aches and pains, and a slight firmness in her lower belly that she wasn't sure was her diet.

*Man, he really did a number on me.*

She glanced down at her right hand, and was surprised to find it ungloved. She realised the must have been too lost in... the moment, to notice that it had been removed with the rest of her clothes. The splotchy green mark, a terrible memory of her past mission, began to throb mildly with pain, as if her noticing its existence had reminded it to do so.
