As he scrawled a quick "closed for business" letter inside Ammo Knights, Pearl and Marina leaned over the counter as Sheldon started from the beginning, recounting his memory of yesterday night. "So I stayed back after closing for a while. Thing is, Lorne's understandably worried over Lily going missing. I had a phonecall with her to try to comfort her."

"How's she holding up?" Marina asked, taking a notepad Pearl had handed to her and jotting notes.

"Not well." Sheldon took another sip of the drink that Crusty Sean had provided. "She's checked in with the rest of the New Squidbeak Splatoon, nobody's seen her since Friday. She did get in contact with the owner of that club Lily plays at, and they *did* confirm she was there to play that night."

"I know the one." Pearl raised an eyebrow. "We were there for her show, so we know she was *there*. If I remember the owner's a bit of a sleazeball at times. Did *he* have anything to do with her disappearance?"

"Lorne says he swore against it," Marina jumped in. "The club owner says she always mentions going to visit one of her DJ friends after her show. Friday was no different."

"DJ friend? Usually Friday night she... oh, hm." Sheldon rubbed his chin in thought.

"Sheldon?" Pearl raised an eyebrow.

"Oh, sorry. Splatoon business," Sheldon clarified. 

"Well it wasn't me. I wasn't aware Lily knew other DJs." Marina thought for a moment, biting her lip gently. "Alright, we'll come back to that. Sadly the Zapfish is more important."

"Right, right." Sheldon stood up from the countertop, and the girls followed him as he stuck the handwritten letter to the door. Marina examined it, reading it through the paper it was written on:

> **CLOSED TODAY**
> 
> Due to a personal matter and ongoing power issues, Ammo Knights will be closed for today and will reopen as normal tomorrow morning.
> 
> Sorry for the inconvenience!
> 
> \- Sheldon

"As I was saying," continued the horseshoe crab, taking his seat back at the counter. "I was leaving late that night, and-- oh, cod, right. Um..."

"What is it?" Pearl and Marina glanced at each other, then back at him with concern.

"Well... I exit the store and I just see... Lily. She's just standing out in the middle of the Square, staring up at the Tower."

"Wait, Lily's okay? Well, Lorne will be relieved to--"

"Hang on." Marina cut Pearl off with a raised hand. "Didn't you say you were ambushed by Octolings out there?"

"Well... yes."

"Then what's going on there?"

"Well I... go to talk to her, try to figure out what happened, and she's acting moody and kind of distant towards me. Heck, I mention the girls and she gets outright hostile!"

"Ehh?!" Both girls were bewildered.

"Right! And she's wearing these odd sunshades or something, and then the Octolings come out and surround me, and they're wearing the same shades, and then the last thing I--"

"Wait. Stop right there." Marina's hand had shot up to her mouth, and her expression had become grave. Pearl simply looked confused. "Describe the shades."

"What? I don't know what this has to do with--"

"Just describe them, Sheldon. Please."

"Uhh... alright. I don't know if they were sunshades or not, they just seemed black, entirely black."

"Did they have a red dot on the eye?"

Sheldon wracked his brain for a moment. "...Yes, actually. They all did."

"Shit!" Marina flung herself from the counter and paced around the store, hands pressed to the sides of her head.

"Uh... 'Rina?" Pearl stared after her, confused and worried. "You okay?"

"Lily didn't just go missing, Pearlie." Marina turned toward her. A shared glance at Sheldon behind the counter told her that he was thinking the same thing she was. "It sounds like Lily was brainwashed by the Octarians."

Pearl furrowed her brows at Marina for a moment, then lowered her head to work this out. "...'Rina...?"

"Pearlie?"

"Did... *Lily* steal the Great Zapfish?"

Marina stopped pacing for a moment, and simply stared at her. Then she started to think about it, and the increasing expression of concern did not ease Pearl's or Sheldon's worries. Finally she said, "I... can't answer that. And that scares me."

"Well, let's assume for a sec. She, or at least this group of Octolings she was with, took it. Why might they do that?"

"Uhh, w-well. They'd need the power." Marina thought hard, recalling what she remembered of her time underground. "Octopia never really got off the ground with energy storage, we always just siphoned power where we could. Something like the Great Zapfish would let them power their entire underground network."

"Just like Inkopolis."

"Just like Inkopolis," Marina nodded. "The thing is, there's only one Octarian who'd try to orchestrate this - who's *kept* orchestrating this."

"So he has to have made them do this, right?" Pearl raised an eyebrow at her.

"DJ Octavio can't have done," Sheldon replied. "The New Squidbeak Splatoon has kept him in captivity for the past year."

"A year's a long time, Sheldon." Marina didn't seem convinced. "Who's checking on him?"

"Well, they all used to at one point," he recalled. "But Lily still does, every Friday night."

"Okay, so I guess it can't..."

Marina trailed off.

Her eyes darted to Sheldon, whose hands clasped over his mouth.

Pearl's head kept turning to see both of their expressions, before gasping, realising what conclusion they were drawing.

"...Where's he being held?" Marina said, her voice just above a whisper, stunned.

"Uhh, T-Tentakeel Hideout."

Immediately Pearl was pulled along as Marina briskly walked out the door. "Right. We're going to check."

Callie was in the Square, having just arrived and was taking in the lack of light, processing what it meant as she saw Pearl and Marina rush out of Ammo Knights and dive into the grate just outside.

She ran up as Sheldon poked his head out of the double doors. "The heck's going on with them?"

"Follow them to Tentakeel Hideout, Callie," Sheldon told her firmly, his face serious. "I have a sinking feeling that Lily's in trouble."

"Okay, but- what... what's going on with all this?!" She waved her arms at the general Square.

"That *might* be related." Sheldon frowned.

Callie processed that for a few moments. As soon as she did, she too took off for the Hideout.
