She blinked, and suddenly she was no longer in the forest. She could no longer see Tartar.

She could no longer see herself.

She was instead looking at a boy, in a dark, dimly lit, underground train station.

She was connected to Tartar, she knew.

And she immediately recognised the boy standing in front of her as Agent Eight. His face was much more confused, more... tense, than when she had first met the boy.

Captain Cuttlefish was next to him, enthusiastic and curious as ever.

The scene seemed frozen in time. An instant of when Tartar had first met them.

*Shortly after Craig and Eight had teamed up*, Lily realised.

Tartar's semi-robotic voice appeared in her head, in her thoughts. "This is Number 10,008. This is who you must find and return."

Lily was astounded at what was happening. *Is this... safe?* she thought to him.

"At this voltage, yes. Hmm - it seems you do recognise him..." She became deeply aware of Tartar glancing through other parts of her memory. "The other, the old man, he may be disposed of as you desire, unless you wish to let my backup plan do the honors..."

Before she could reply, the scene went black, and in the next instance, she was somewhere else again.

She was back in the forest. Back in the clearing.

This time, she was in the place of Tartar.

And in front of her stood Marina and Pearl.

They both wore the faces of two people who were exhausted, and wanted nothing more to be rid of the burden they had both been carrying.

"These two may be eliminated with *extreme* prejudice," Tartar said simply. "Make sure their last moments are filled with suffering. Make sure they *know* they're dying. ...Ah, seems you recognise them... hmm, from where...?"

The scene changed again.

This time, though, Lily recognised it immediately.

They were both looking through her own eyes, as Pearl and Agent 8 pointed their weapons at her, down in the Inkopolis sewers. "I see, I see..." Tartar's voice murmured in her head.

*Hey hang on---* was all Lily managed to get out to him, realising that he had begun looking through her memories.

She was somewhere else again - Tentakeel Hideout, the night the Octolings first attacked her. She was glancing back at the oncoming squad, hot on her tail.

Again - Standing in the crowd at the New Albacore Hotel with Lorne, Sheldon and that Roller boy. "Were these... friends of yours...?"

*Uhh---*

Again - talking with Lorne, Callie and Marie at the Hideout. "Hang on..."

Again - talking with Lorne and Marina on the train. "I don't believe this."

Again - the Squidbeak meeting with Off the Hook... and Eight.

*I can---*

"I DON'T BELIEVE THIS!" Tartar bellowed, staring at the scene through Lily's eyes, and a fresh, more powerful surge of electricity zapped through her body, causing her to scream involuntarily. The invisible grip on her finger tightened, and the goop she had nearly forgotten connected them crawled up the digit. "You befriended them! You gave up your humanity to be more like them!"

*I...I told you I had to to keep myself from---*

"LIAR!" Another surge of electricity, and her vision faded into glitchy static. "I am in here with your thoughts! You used me... In the name of what? To save them?"

*I wanted these answers for myself!* She thought at him, even as her body struggled to keep in control of itself under the increased current.

"Shame... Then at least I will have the satisfaction of disposing of you. You're a traitor to the human race! Be glad that what's left of your human DNA will be part of the perfect..."

The scene changed one last time.

It was herself, sat alone in the Tentakeel Hideout. It was nighttime.

She was holding a stack of documents.

*...The documents that proved that I had no human DNA left*, she realised grimly.

The frustrated noise that Tartar made was a squeal of digital noise, certainly inhuman as he cranked up the voltage, his grip extending up her hand as it itself began to sting and burn.

She heard a sizzling noise. She was burning up. She knew it was her own body. She knew that the electricity, the energy was cooking her alive.

She realised that Tartar was going to kill her. And there was nothing she seemed able to do to fight back except watch the whirlwind of memories flash in front of her.

*But... I'm... human...*

"YOU WERE NEVER HUMAN, YOU USELESS, TRAITOROUS WORM!" Tartar bellowed in her thoughts. "Now be a good boy and---"

The whirlwind of scenes halted, and Tartar went quiet briefly. His attack on Lily paused, at least briefly, and she took the chance to gulp down fresh, cool air to soothe her burning insides. She forgot where the air was coming from.

But what she was being shown made her forget the situation, for a moment.

They were both looking, again through Lily's eyes, at a long beach.

The sand stretched on into the distance, where eroded cliffs rose from sea level and shrubs and plantlife grew atop them. Washed-up seaweed was strewn on the dry sand, untouched by the lower tides.

It seemed untouched by civilization.

Except for herself and the six other people in front of her.

Lily stifled a sob.

For in front of her and Tartar, walking along the beach with her, frozen in time, was her family.

Her human family.

Her mother and her grandmother were just ahead, almost close enough to touch. She had been hanging back with them.

About fifteen meters ahead of them were the rest of them - her father, brother, younger sister, and uncle.

This was their Christmas gathering, last year.

Inky tears streaked down Lily's face. She missed them, so much.

They were so close, yet so far away.

"Hmm. Well isn't that nice," Tartar's voice mused casually in her mind. "A family of subhumans."

Lily blinked. Her mouth dropped open.

*How... dare you.*

Her free hand curled into a fist, and her struggles to free herself renewed as a rush of anger surged through her. *HOW DARE YOU!*

"You heard me, speck!" More electricity poured into her again, and she screamed out in pain as her body began to heat up once again. "Be glad they died in service of bringing you to this forsaken place, Simon! For even your mother could not love what you have become... RACE TRAITOR!"

The voltage climbed upward. The heat was unbearable. She could not think of another response, could only watch the image of her loved ones slowly fade as her vision dimmed.

"You'll be with them shortly."

She became vaguely aware that she was being pulled backwards, just as she thought she was going to black out for the last time.

And suddenly found her senses freak out as she was forcefully separated from Tartar, the force of whatever had been tugging her back, flinging her backwards onto the grass.

Separated from its host, the few tendrils of Tartar's biological mass that had attached itself to Lily, oozed onto the grass, melting away.

Leaving the skin underneath stained with its color.
