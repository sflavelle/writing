## Vivid Memories Turn to Fantasies

The group of seven stepped out of the train onto the platform of Triggerfish Station.

It was a small, quiet station, with just enough platform for the train, and a singular terminal for ticket purchases near the platform exit, by which a wooden sign signalled 'This way to Camp Triggerfish!'.

The station was surrounded by great pine trees, towering over them, and the pleasant scent of pine needles and nature wafted in their direction. Lily took a deep breath, and sighed happily. *The world is still beautiful...*

She followed the group as they headed down the lone dirt path through the trees, already seeing a structure not too far off. Wooden towers and ramps... "Hey, anyone know what that thing is up ahead?"

"That's Camp Triggerfish!" Pearl said with a grin. "Where all the young squids go for a new adventure! Plus it's a battle stage sometimes."

"Not at the moment though," Marina chimed in as the path took them along a lake, upon which was Triggerfish's battle stage. "It's not on the schedule for a few weeks, so it'll be nice and quiet today."

"Good thing, too," Craig remarked. "Since we're on official business."

Camp Triggerfish, at least from what Lily saw from the sidelines as they ventured past, seemed like the 'summer camps' she would see on American cartoons and video games. Camp fire pits, wooden buildings, and the idea of being 'one with nature'... or was that 'conquering nature'? It seemed like more of the former here.

The structure that Lily had first seen was Triggerfish's battle stage. It was built and suspended over a lake (by who and how, Lily wondered) where, she supposed, the campgoers could unwind and make a mess.

On the other side of the lake, past a set of dormitories, was a set of public toilets, and there Craig called the group to a halt. "Alright, Agents. We should take this opportunity to get into gear. Use these bathrooms here, get into your Hero Suits, and these ladies and I will be waiting out here."

"Now seems like a good time for it," Lorne agreed. "Alright, Lily, let's get changed." She made her way into one of the bathrooms, and Remo quietly made his way to another. Eight followed behind them, following Craig's instruction.

"I'll be with you in a sec," Lily called, then turned to Craig. "I know this is rather spur of the moment, but I think it may be best if I *didn't* change."

Captain Cuttlefish looked at her with concern. "I can't say I understand your reasoning, Five."

Lily nodded. "Well, I'm thinking about it like this, sir. Tartar has met and... used Agent 3 already. He knows what the Agent gear would look like. If I face him looking like that, I think he might get aggressive."

"Ohhhh." The idea seemed to dawn on Pearl. "I think I get it. If you don't *look* like one of the Agents, then you could sell your story better and he might be willing to part with info. Clever, Lily."

Lily grinned. "Exactly."

"Well..." Craig scratched at his beard. "That is certainly a thought." He thought for a few seconds. "Alright, Lily. I think you may be right. Let's see how that goes."

Lily nodded at him. "I think it will work in our favour."
