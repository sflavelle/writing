She heard the quiet chatter of the group behind her fade underneath the whoosh and whistle of wind through the trees the further out she ventured.

The markers were much closer now as the dense foliage returned, a sign to Lily that her destination was imminent.

Her nerves began to flare up again.

*This was insane*, she told herself.

She was going to meet the would-be destroyer of the world.

And *talk to him*. Pretend to *be on his side.*

*God, I can't believe I'm actually doing this... When did my life become a fuckin' cartoon...?*

For the first time, she became aware of the sound of the forest, what she could hear.

Or rather, what she *couldn't*.

Something hadn't felt quite right as she had ventured with the group, but now that there was nothing but the forest to listen to, she was finally able to pinpoint what it was.

*There were no birds.*

She had seen the occasional bird in the city, but it was just... strange to not hear any sort of bird calls or general chirping out here. She had expected not to see any animals, but to just hear the wind, the creaking and cracking of trees and branches, and nothing else made the place feel... almost dead, like she was wandering an empty world.

She reached the final marker. A few bushes obscured the final steps into Tartar's domain.

This marker was accompanied by a signpost beneath it. White text on a red background proclaimed "DANGEROUS ENVIRONMENT AHEAD - TURN BACK".

Oh, how she wished she could.

She sighed, took a few deep breaths. She reached for the radio Pearl had given her, and pressed and engaged the transmission lock.

Now everything she said and heard would be sent back to the group behind her.

Now there was nothing else to do but... meet him.

With another deep breath, she pushed through the bushes, and emerged into a forest clearing.

Trees were dotted in a rough circle around this large space, and light streamed in through the canopy here.

And with the sunlight, lush, soft grass grew all over the open space.

It was a pretty sight.

There was something odd about it all, though.

The old-timey telephone box, perched motionless on a single tree stump across from her.

Commander Tartar, so Lily had been told.

If she had to guess without prior knowledge, it would have come from the 1940s or 50s. Two bells sat on either side, which she imagined a hammer would have rung when a call came in. The speaker, which was an old-timey brass piece you would hold to your ear, sat underneath, like a mouth. A handcrank hung from its side, and Lily wasn't immediately sure what it was for.

She wondered, though, if people at the time knew they were making something that looked slightly anthropomorphic.

The telephone box had been busted quite badly. Gaps in its paneling exposed its inner workings. From a distance, she couldn't make out what was inside.

But she could see the strange greenish ooze that had leaked from a small gap in the bottom of the panel onto the tree stump, and pooled down on the ground.

Lily had no idea what it was, and it only kept her nerves up.

He was placed facing the path Lily had just emerged from. She watched the telephone carefully as she approached, but so far he made no motion or sound.

She briefly wondered whether he *didn't* know she was here, if he was saving power or something.

But as she got within ten meters of the telephone box, its features almost seemed to contort as a tinny voice rang out, modulated as if spoken from...a telephone. "State your business, seafood."

*Seafood? Really?* Lily slowed, but continued to make her way toward him. "So *you're* the one giving us humans a bad name. I figure if---"

"Who is 'us humans'? You are not." The telephone's speakers contorted, rotating on an axis almost as if he was rolling his eyes.

Lily had expected not to be believed and had thought about how she would introduce herself on the last stretch of forest. Stopping before him, lowering the hoodie's hood, she took a deep breath, briefly speaking in English. "I am aware of my appearance, but I assure you I am human by heart."

"I beg your pardon?" Tartar eyed her suspiciously. It almost seemed to her like he was *daring* her to keep that up.

Lily continued, speaking fluent English (though with a slight warble, her inkling accent): "I am a human from the year 2018. I was brought here to this time and I'm not sure why."

Tartar eyed her carefully. Then, in English, he demanded: "Who *are* you to come here and pretend you are one of us? How *dare you*, you insignificant, barely sapient---"

"My name is Simon," Lily cut in, speaking more forcefully. "The creatures here have called me Lily. I am a resident of the country of Australia. I didn't live in a seismically active area, but I was effectively killed when a ravine opened up under my house. I was brought here with no clue and nothing left to my name, and... *forced* to live among these... *'Inklings'*." She forced herself to shudder, trying to sell it to this AI. "Their ink... they changed me..."

The telephone box stared at her, considering what he was told. Eventually, he said, in a softer, more lighthearted tone, "Can you prove to me that what you are saying is true?"

Lily nodded, and silently she felt in her pocket for her iPhone, pulling it out. She showed the front of the device first, before turning it around to show the all-important Apple logo.

Tartar was briefly silent. Then, another voice, calm, female, spoke through his speakers.

"\[RETRIEVING HISTORICAL RECORDS\]."

Lily smiled. *At least he's considering the idea.*

He was silent again for at least ten seconds. Then he finally spoke. He was no longer angry, or suspicious. He seemed, incredibly, to believe Lily. "So my support has finally arrived..."

Lily's heart dropped, even as she mentally breathed a sigh of relief. *Saved by capitalism. Christ.* "Support...?"

"Yes... I requested additional help to accomplish our mission, per the decisions your superiors and I have made. They informed me a month ago that you had been sent. Why has it taken you this long to report to me?" Tartar's speakers contorted again, looking almost annoyed at her.

Lily took a moment to respond. "So... your lot were responsible for me being here... I'd suspected, since you and I were the only human or human-made creatures here, but---"

"What nonsense are you speaking, Simon?" Lily flinched as it used her old name. "You are an employee of NILS, are you not?"

"...No. Not that I'm aware of. But, well, I'm here now..."

"How did you find this place, then? Why have you found me?"

It took a moment for Lily to respond, struggling with the confirmation of what she had worried was the case. "I... earned the trust of one of the squids that defeated you, and they divulged your location." *Well, it was technically true,* Lily thought. "I'm here because... I... I need answers. I'm homesick. I miss *our* Earth."

There was silence. Eventually the telephone asked, "You *met* the things that did this to me?"

"Yes... They found *me*, actually." Lily sighed. "They figured out what I was after your defeat. To... prevent my own death, I played the part of a sympathetic entity and gained their trust."

"I see..." Tartar thought for a moment. "I miss our time too, Simon," he finally agreed, and almost seemed to sigh. "I miss my team at NILS. It feels like forever ago that I was still connected to them. That I could still talk with them. Especially the professor... my creator..."

Lily nodded. "Feels like a long time since I have been able to talk with my friends too."

"Mmm." Tartar fell silent, and Lily took the opportunity to glance again at the clearing around her."Very well then, Simon. I will tell you what you wish to know. In return, we shall collaborate to accomplish a task I have been working to complete for the last twelve thousand years. Do you agree?"

Lily was silent, and glanced down at the ground while she thought.

She realised she was going to have to commit to this facade, at least until she got what she needed.

She thought about her friends, listening to her every word.

And though she had told them, multiple times, that she would have to pretend to be on his side to get the answers she needed, she hoped that they understood what she would have to say in order to get there.

So, Lily glanced back up at Tartar, and with a deep breath, nodded. "Alright, Tartar. I'll play along. But I want my answers first. I've been put through this hell long enough."

"Very well, Simon." Tartar's voice softened. He was relaxed. "Since you are not an employee, I suppose I shall inform you. The National Institute of Life Sciences has been a top-secret US project for quite some time, unknown to even the President. Our goal has changed over the millenia. At our formation, we wanted to do what we could to allow the human race to survive, as we faced rising temperatures and melting polar ice.

"I was brought online in the summer of 2015 to survey and collect meteorological data, and advise my colleagues via Temporal Networking. As you probably understand by now, I determined that we would be unsuccessful in our mission, with the methods we were using. And so---"

"Hang on." Lily stared at him in wonder. "'Temporal Networking'? Like time travel?"

"Yes and no," Tartar stated matter-of-factly. "We made use of a top-secret technology developed in the mid-2010s to connect their networks from 2017 onwards to my own servers at a time period of their choosing, but never travelling backward from a previous connection. The NILS Statue, where I was housed and where my servers were located, was fitted with one such temporal networking socket. The NILS offices were fitted with the other. The miniature time warp these created were way too small to transport anything more than data."

"Oh..." Lily felt disappointed. "So then, how did I get here?"

"I will get to that, Simon. Please allow me to finish." Tartar seemed to sigh. "Now then. Since we determined that saving the human race was not possible, NILS' goal became two-fold. One, much like NASA's Voyager Record, we wanted to collect the knowledge from the greatest minds, the research of the whole of humankind, into one place where extraterrestrials or newly formed sapient species may find and make use of it.

"Two, I was authorized to begin a new experiment on behalf of my superiors. The theory goes that if one took the very best of humanity, you could create what the public would call 'superhumans'. So then, what if we applied this thinking to all of life, consuming its very best? Could we, then, create something larger than life? Could we create something truly... perfect?"

Tartar fell silent. Lily eventually realised that he was done talking. "And did you manage to...?"

"Not yet... But now, with human DNA to use, I feel we will be very, very close." The AI paused once again, thinking. "That ties into what I wish to ask you to do for me. But, as promised, Simon, I will allow you to ask what you desire of me."

Lily nodded, wishing he would stop saying her old name so often. She thought about the questions she had had. "Very well, Tartar. You implied that NILS had something to do with my getting brought here. This was my first question."

"Yes, we did. Staff at the Institute figured out how they may be able to create a larger time warp, and initiated a test. It seems then, that they were not able to control where it was created, the effects it would have when created under the earth, and how long it would last. We did not expect to collect a person as a result. But, as it turns out, despite the small impact on the local community, they would not be missed in their own time, and you would, in fact, be of much greater use here."

"Uh--- pardon?" *Did he really just say I wasn't missed back home...?*

"What was your next question?" Tartar said promptly, dismissing her concern.

"I--- uh... Right..." Lily ran a hand over her face, and her expression sank. *Jesus Christ...* "So, if...did they ever manage to find a way to create a portal *back* to that time? Could I return?"

"No," Tartar said flatly. "Besides, why would you wish to? Did you not hear what I said?"

"Oh, I heard. But I still have friends from that time who I'd want to talk to and let them know I'm OK..."

"Then perhaps this will give you some comfort, Simon. Take that iPhone of yours to the NILS Statue, out in the bay. The structure may be damaged beyond repair, but from my last diagnostics before I was torn from that structure, the temporal network is still online. You should be able to access the internet of 2018 from that phone. This is my gift to you, as a token of our working relationship."

Lily was almost about to cry tears of relief. *There was a way to talk to her friends. Thank fuck.* "Thank you... I'm so relieved to hear that. That would go a long way to easing my homesickness..."

"As it should. Any other questions? Or shall we get to business?"

"...One last question, sir." Lily sighed. "Clearly the human race did not survive, but...what killed us in the end...?"

Tartar did not respond for some time. When he did finally speak, his voice was more somber. "I did mention that rising waters was a factor. But... it set off a chain of events that ultimately led to our extinction.

"As you may be aware, Earth had a population of 7.6 billion by the time you left 2018. With less land for those people to live on, tensions and attitudes grew drastic. As soon as countries started to migrate to higher ground, into other lands, that ended up being the last straw for militaries and foreign governments. Global war broke out in weeks.

"Finally, several nuclear-capable forces used the panic to fire their arsenal, causing the US to retaliate..." Tartar paused, and Lily's hearts went cold, realising. "Most of the planet has been uninhabitable for some time since."

Lily stared at the ground and slowly sank to her knees.

*Of course we nuked ourselves into oblivion.*

*Fuckin' of course.*

She looked up, and sighed. "I suppose I didn't expect any less from our species."

"I will not have you speak of our creators that way," the telephone said sternly. "Humans have had their failures, yes, but as a whole we have accomplished incredible things together. And the two of us still have our greatest work yet ahead. Shall we move on?"

Lily sighed, and sadly nodded, images of nuclear bombs still running through her head. "...A-alright. What do you have?"

"OK. Let's talk shop." His voice had reset to a more robotic speech, now that he'd supposedly won her over. "Simon. As you may have figured out, I am unable to move and undertake this task myself, so I must ask you to undertake this for me. But I must ask you first to pledge to me that you will do what I ask. It is of the utmost importance."

Lily stared at him. It didn't feel like a good sign that he wanted her allegiance *before* telling her what his deal was. She feared the worst.

A small part of her noted: *You can just walk away at any time, you know. He can't stop you.*

Lily's body, however, stayed rooted in place. Slowly, anxious about the consequences, she asked, "I am already here... Do you not trust me?"

"Simon..." Tartar sighed deeply. "I need *you* to trust *me*. I do hope you have not grown attached to these overgrown, pitiful excuses for seafood."

Lily had to bite her tongue to stop herself from saying what she was feeling at that moment. She turned away for a moment to keep the anger from showing on her face.

She turned back. In a voice of voiced calm, trying not to betray her true emotions, she said, "I... *trust* you, Tartar. What are you trying to do?"

Tartar seemed satisfied. "Part of my research on creating the perfect lifeform involves cultivating the best of a worthy species, and disposing of those that are not. Through testing with my business partner, we have determined *one* candidate from the current gene pool. And as you are already aware, my plans to put that DNA to use have been... delayed, shall we say.

"To that end, I have two tasks for you. One, you must find Number 10,008 for me. He is the successful testing candidate. An 'Octoling'. Bring him here. Extract his DNA using the equipment left in the Statue. His will be used in the making of the perfect life."

*Number 10,008? Does he mean... Agent 8?* Deciding to feign ignorance, Lily asked, "What does he look like?"

"Like every other damned mutant octopus around here," Tartar spat. Then he paused. He seemed to have an idea. "Actually, I may be able to show you. Touch my essence, Simon, and I shall transmit the information."

*Tartar's... essence?* Lily's face scrunched up as her thoughts immediately went to less pure things. She glanced around him. Did he mean the... slime, or ink, or whatever, that was oozing from his frame? "This.. inky stuff?" She asked, gesturing at it. "What even is it?"

"Do *not* call it ink!" Tartar barked at her. "It is a biological byproduct of my research. I have learned to use it as an extension of my digital- and silicon-based self when it is connected to my circuits." He took a moment, again resetting his attitude. "Please, do not feel nervous. You should only feel a slight static shock."

She stared at the goop. *I really shouldn't be doing this*, she thought to herself.

*But, let's... confirm for absolute certainty that he's really asking me to do away with Eight. And... everyone, I guess.*

Nervously, she reached out... and dipped a finger in the sludge.

Immediately a loud 'snap' and an electric shock surged through her body, and she found herself frozen in place as the stuff latched onto her finger.
