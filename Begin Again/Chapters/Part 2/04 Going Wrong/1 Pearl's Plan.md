## Going Wrong

"Marina, we've been keeping watch for *eeever*. Just wake her up already."

"It's been like half an hour, you two. You don't take a hit like that and just get back up right away..."

Light streamed in from the open end of the sewer tunnel not too far away from the group that sat just inside. Marina and (reluctantly) Eight had carried Lily's unconscious body away from the Square to a more secluded part of the system. A facility they had passed, built into the sewer tunnels, filtered the ink from the flows, and clear water and oil now emptied from here into the canals just ahead.

Initially, the plan was just to question the human where they were. But after a close encounter with an Inkling up on the surface nearly stumbling upon them, they had decided to move further up, to where the tunnels joined the main canal.

"Yeah, but we got *things* to do! We can't just sit around like this! Why don't we just chuck her in the canal and call it a day?"

Marina looked up from browsing through Lily's iPhone. "Pearl, that's called murder." She had discovered the fingerprint lock mechanism, and had figured it out enough to try unlocking the phone with Lily's thumbs. Naturally, it had worked. Now she sat next to the unconscious Inkling as she looked through random applications and messages, wishing she could understand the text...

"And? Marina, she's *human*, remember?" Pearl turned her back to the tunnel entrance and faced the Octos. "She doesn't *belong* in this world."

"No, she doesn't. But at the same time..." Marina paused to think. "No, I can't allow it. I wanna know what she has to say first. Then if there's any way to send her back..."

"Well, at least wake her up, yo! I'm tired of waiting around!"

Marina sighed. "Well, perhaps some of those strong smelling salts would do the trick... I didn't think to bring any with me, and I think that's probably the quickest way to do that. I can go back and get some, if you and Eight will watch Lily."

"Yeah, okay. We can handle her." Pearl nodded, already forming a plan. "We've got this!"

"Great. Alright." Marina stood up, having knelt and examined Lily carefully. "I'll be back shortly, alright? Fifteen minutes, max." She started to jog back into the tunnel, waving back at Pearl and Agent Eight.

Pearl waved until her bandmate had disappeared behind a corner, then turned to Eight. "She's got a point, Eight, but we can't afford to waste time on this. Who knows what'll happen, eh? I know just how to wake her up. Watch this."

Pearl pulled out her Dualies as she approached Lily's body, straddling her. She watched her face quietly for a few moments, noticing she had gone into a regular sleep. Then she raised her right hand and smacked the side of one of the Dualies against Lily's temple.

The low groan from the Inkling told Pearl what she wanted to know - she was waking.
