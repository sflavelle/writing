Agent 4 checked her phone yet again. Still no messages. *Come on, Lily...*

Since Lily had left about an hour and some ago, she had eagerly awaited her next message, that would tell her she had made it to the Hideout.

But that message had not arrived. *She should have made it safely by now... What if they had caught her?*

*What if she had never arri---* 

The chime of the doorbell broke her chain of thought, and she panicked. *Oh no, what if she was right, and* they are *here to... have words with me?*

She grabbed her Hero Shot from the kitchen bench and inched her way over to the door.

Slowly, quietly, in case she had to pretend she wasn't there, she looked through the peephole.

And sawÂ Marie, Callie, and... a battered Lily.

She quickly unlocked and opened the door, tossing her weapon aside. "Oh my cod!" she cried out as she assisted them, guiding Lily to the couch to crash. "What happened?!"

"She got ambushed beneath the Square," Marie told her. "They knew she was going via the sewers. I'm glad I thought to come and find her, as you can tell they got... pretty physical with her." The two sat on either side of Lily, but Lorne quickly pulled her into an embrace while Marie leaned forward to look into the girl's eyes. "Hey, you alright in there? You've not said a word since I found you."

Lily turned her head slowly to look at her. Swallowing, she said, "They beat me around the head kinda hard. The pain is making it hard to think right now. But thank you for coming to help me. And sorry."

"Ssshhhh. You're fine." Marie rested her hand on her shoulder. "We know you way better than they do. We've got your back."

As Marie told Lorne about what she had found in the sewers, Callie placed her backpack down on the floor. Everything had (thankfully) been left intact. The bag was a mess though - it was clear that everything had been pulled out and then jammed back in. She did notice a lack of something though... "Uhh, Lily's phones are missing," she announced to the group.

"Oh, shit right..." Lily said, a little slowly as she nuzzled into Lorne's shoulder. "Apparently Marina has them..."

"Oh, *joy*." Lorne sighed. "So, what now?"

"Well... First I rest up." Lily sighed deeply, noticing the pain was beginning to dull. "And then I guess I'm just gonna have to sit down with 'em and *prove* I'm no threat."

"And hopefully work out what the deal is with this Tartar nonsense," added Marie. "They seem to have Lily confused for some other person that *is* or at least *was* a threat."

"But to do *this* to her?" Lorne gestured at her friend. "I thought Pearl and Marina were better than this."

"I mean, if they were convinced she was a world-ending threat..." Callie frowned. She was in the kitchenette, fixing everyone up glasses of milk as she spoke. "Not that that makes it right, but..."

"Of course it doesn't!" Lorne said, raising her voice and startling Lily slightly. "They should know better than to just... do what they did, human or not!"

"*Marina* should know better," Marie corrected. "And maybe she does now, now that we've shaken her up a bit. She'd've been in Lily's shoes when she first arrived. Pearl, I'm not sure she gets it yet..."

"I don't know her as well as you two probably do," Lorne started, "but she doesn't strike me as the type to think this sort of situation through!"

Callie and Marie both made non-committal grunts. "It's hard to say," Callie said, as she handed out glasses of milk to the rest of the crew, and sat on the couch arm next to Marie. "There are some things she does really well, I mean she promoted Off the Hook on her own when they first got together. And yeah, she got a little wild now and then, but this... Maybe it's worth investigating this thing they keep mentioning, cous'."

"...Yeah, I think you're right." Marie thought for a moment, looking intently at Lorne and Lily as she sipped at her milk glass. "Lily. Agent 5. Are... you still up for our kinda work? I know it's been real rough today..."

Lily stared sleepily up at her, having curled up on the couch, her head resting in Lorne's lap. She said simply, "I gotta..."

"Sure, but do you *want* to? Because if you do, I'll have a task for you and Agent 4 that will involve this Tartar character."

Lily thought for a few long moments, but nodded. "I'll do what I can," she yawned, "to keep everyone safe."

Marie smiled, satisfied. "Alright," she began. "When you do go and see Marina and Pearl again, first off I... think I'd like you to bring Four with you as support. No need for you to be on your own again if things go downhill. OK, Four?"

Lorne nodded. "I'd be glad to protect her."

"Secondly, I want you to find out from them what exactly happened with Tartar, what NILS is, all that. Find out where they were last seen. Then report back to us, and we'll all figure out where to go from there. That sound good?"

Lily nodded silently.

"Cool. Don't worry, Lily. We've got your back."

"I wish Gramps were here..." Callie sighed. "His insight would be so helpful..."

"Yeah..." Marie sighed. "He and Agent 3 have been gone for quite a while now. I hope that their work has been going alright..."

"They know what they're doing. I bet they're doing just fine." Callie smiled. "I just wish he'd get in touch..."

Marie nodded. "I hope he comes back soon. I'm sure he would love to meet the new Agents."

"I would love to meet him one day," Lorne smiled at them. She had sat Lily up, who was still looking a little groggy, and sipped at her glass.

Marie nodded again, and the apartment was quiet for a minute as everyone drank up. 

Lorne reached for the remote during this downtime and flicked on the TV. There was a League battle being broadcast, whom three of the girls recognised were two of the higher-ranked teams duking it out in a Tower Control setting. The network was providing its own commentary.

"Oh, sweet!" Callie perked up. I haven't seen these guys playing in ages. Mind if we watch?" She asked Lorne.

"Not at all," Lorne smiled. "You a sports person, Lily?"

"This sorta sports, I could get into I think." Lily rubbed the back of her head and found her gaze drawn to the television screen. She found herself easily distracted by the battle unfolding.

"I heard you did pretty well for your first battle," Marie complimented, glad the conversation was pivoting away from business. "Who knows, this could be you one day."

"Funny."

"Well, keep training and battling and we'll see, mm?" Callie smiled at her. 

Everyone started to relax as they enjoyed the battles on TV. Callie and Marie both ended up staying for dinner, ordering from the local "Fish's Chip Takeaway" and enjoying some hot, deep-fried, crunchy chips with their Agents. 

When they finally said their farewells, well after the sun had set, the mood had much improved, and Lily felt more confident that she might be able to deal with Off the Hook.

And as she and Lorne got into bed for the night, she was once again reminded of just how glad she was to have them as friends.

Lily just hoped the throbbing pain in her forehead would go away.
