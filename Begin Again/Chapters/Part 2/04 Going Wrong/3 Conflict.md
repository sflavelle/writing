"Don't come any closer!" Pearl and Eight stood up, training their weapons in the direction of the voice, further into the darkness of the sewer tunnels. Lily also looked over, hopeful.

At first, they didn't see anything.

Then two figures came around the corner, not too far away, coming towards them. The first was clearly Marina, and she *had* brought some smelling salts to awaken Lily.

But Marina had led someone to them. And judging by the custom Brella pointed at her back, not by choice. She looked ashamed as her eyes met Pearl's.

The person behind Marina...

Pearl's hearts sank.

The intruder's face dropped as she came closer, and her brandished custom Brella lowered slightly. Her eyes darted from Pearl, to Lily, to the Octoling boy in gear similar to, but not quite like, Octavio's own forces.

"No..." Marie breathed in shock. "I would never have believed you, *both* of you, would be working with the enemy."

Marina blinked, and swapped glances with her friends, the color draining from her face. "M-Marie... No... We..."

"Let go of her and step aside. Now." Marie refocused her Brella on Marina. "Don't make me use this on her..."

"I can't believe you're working with the human!" Pearl spat, raising her Dualies again *at Marie*.

"Pearlie! Stop!" Marina gasped out. She was caught in the middle of this standoff. This was not a situation she wanted to be in.

"Yes, I am!" Marie slowly stepped towards them, keeping her Brella up, pushing Marina forward. "I don't know why you're spreading these rumors, but I will personally vouch for her credibility!"

Pearl seemed taken aback by the accusation. "They aren't rumors!" she cried out. "We saw the threat with our own eyes! We *stopped* the threat, for goodness sake! We're stopping her before the humans try again to wipe us all out for good! *Including* you, Marie!"

"You're being ridiculous. What about him?" Marie pointed her weapon at Eight, and Eight reflexively trained his weapon on her. "Don't try it, octoslob."

"He's on our side!" Pearl yelled. "I mean, he's on your side. I mean..."

"He's a refugee," clarified Marina. "We helped him escape, and start a new life! What we went through to get him here is *why* we're so concerned about the human!"

"Why are you telling her?!" hissed Pearl in Marina's direction.

"She needs to know the *facts*," Marina replied, facing her but clearly addressing Marie. "To know just what she has sided with."

"I know exactly who I've sided with, thanks." Marie inched the two of them closer, at least until the Octo boy raised his weapon again. "And she is nothing like I have heard from you both. I'd know, I found the poor girl in the first place."

"You WHAT?!" Pearl yelled at her, astounded. "*You* are the one that unleashed Tartar upon us?!"

"I didn't unle--- wait, who?" Marie furrowed her brows. *Who on earth...?* "Who the heck is Tartar? I only know a Lily." She nodded at the body sat on the ground. "And she's been with me or A--- ...or her friend Lorne ever since she got here. You don't truly believe *me* to be working against Inkopolis, do you?"

"Well... n-no but... humans---"

"Are extinct now." Marie tried to put on a friendlier voice. She hoped she would be able to get them to at least stand down... "Yes, one has survived, somehow. But from all of my time working and hanging out with her, she has been the complete opposite of what you have said humans are like." She sighed. "Even if humans do somehow become a threat in the future, I assure you that she will not be one of them. She's embraced her new life, as *one of us*. Now lower your weapons and let me treat her."

"You first," Pearl said firmly, not entirely convinced.

"I'll put my weapon down if you do," Marie offered.

Pearl sighed. "Let Marina go and we'll do it."

Marie rolled her eyes. "I won't let her go *free*, but I'll let her return over to you." She nudged the idol in their direction and, slowly, Marina got the hint, crossing the gap between them, returning to Pearl and Eight.

Pearl nodded. "Fine... We'll all go on three."

Marie nodded, and slowly began to lower the Brella, watching Pearl and Eight carefully. "One... Two..."

Both Pearl and Eight reluctantly began to drop their weapons to their side.

"Three."

Marie's Brella hung limply from her hand, as did Pearl's Dualies and Eight's Octoshot.

"Much better." Marie closed the distance between them cautiously, and knelt down before Lily's form, examining her bruises and squeezing her hand comfortingly. Now that Marie was up close with her, she noticed that her clothes were rough and worn from being dragged against the concrete for such a long distance.

"So... what's *actually* going on, then?" Marina quietly asked. "Who is she?"

Marie looked at the three of them silently before answering, "She was brought here against her will. I was the one who found her, so... we became friends. I've been helping her settle into the city with the help of Sheldon and Lorne. That's all I feel comfortable saying for now, especially after this stunt you've pulled."

She stood up, turning to them. "Now I strongly recommend you three go back to whatever you were doing before you decided to terrorize this poor girl. I'll be taking her back to her place. Come on, Lily, up you get..." She bent down briefly to help the pained Inkling slowly get to her feet. "We'll chat about this some other time, girls. And I expect your full co-ordination from now on." They started to walk down the sewer path, back the way they had came.

Pearl, Marina, and Eight stared after her as she left, then looked at each other.

"Oh, and Marina..."

"Yes... Marie?"

"If I hear that you've started working for Octavio again, I *will* be back. *We* will be back. Am I clear?"

"...Yes, Marie. No chance of that happening."

"Good. You all take care now."

And Marie half-carried Lily as they made their way back.

Pearl cocked her head in Marina's direction. "What on Earth happened there?"

Marina sighed, not turning to face her. "She jumped me when I got back to the Square after getting those salts... Lily's phone had gotten a message, but I didn't know who it was from until I got back down into the sewers and was ambushed." She sighed and finally turned back to Pearl and Eight. "Did you get much out of her?"

"A bit..." Pearl kicked the concrete ground in annoyance. "She's really sticking to the idea that she doesn't know about Tartar or NILS at all. Swears she *is* an Inkling now. Says she was brought to our time but not of her own accord."

"Hm..." Marina thought quietly. *Something is still clearly up, but... I guess it's possible she could, in fact, be a bystander of sorts...*

"Marina..." Pearl prodded her bandmate. "What did Marie mean? Who's Octavio?"

"Ah... that's a bit of a long story," Marina said nervously, sharing a glance with Agent Eight. "I guess we can tell it on the way back. Wanna learn about my old boss?"
