Lily was smacked awake some unknown time after being knocked out. Her head seared with pain from the earlier blow and her vision swam briefly as she tried to make sense of where she was.

"Oy. Eyes up here." Someone in white was standing in front of her. She blinked her eyes a few times, and they came into focus. 

It was Pearl. And she was aiming a pair of Splat Dualies right at her.

She seemed to have been dragged up against the wall of the sewer tunnel. She guessed that she may have been too heavy to be moved away from the sewers, but she was now not too far off from the end of the underground tunnel. Her hands were also bound behind her back.

The Octoling boy was with them, to her left - he had his own weapon, Splattershot-like, also aimed at her. 

Lily sighed, and closed her eyes. "Well? What's the hold-up? Do it already."

"Nuh uh," Pearl said with a smirk. "It's time to talk."

Grumbling, Lily looked around for other options. Maybe she could get herself into the ink river, assuming it didn't hurt, and get to safety that way? She focused for a moment, turning into a squid before they knew what was happening.

Except that she couldn't. 

For whatever reason, the vibrations of the device that still rumbled on her back wereÂ  preventing her from changing.

"Hey, what the?" Lily exclaimed. "What did you do to me?!"

Pearl smirked. "Eight tells me a Disruptor basically stops the target from changing forms while it's active. So no way you're going squid around us. And," she let a bit of teeth show, stepping a bit closer, "that does mean you won't be allowed to respawn if you're a bad human. So you better behave, yeah?"

Lily thought about this. "That... basically means I'll die, right?"

"Oh would you look at that." The smirk grew ever-wider. "I guess humans *are* somewhat intelligent."

"Why, Pearl?" Lily sighed, watching the Dualie barrels carefully. "Why are you guys so angry and scared of me? I swear I'm not dangerous..."

"You know exactly why, human. I guess it's too bad your little toy statue didn't kill us all, huh? 'Cuz now we're gonna take our revenge on you."

Lily's face dropped, and her brows furrowed in confusion. *Oh... this is gonna suck...*

"Alright kid, 'fess up." Pearl pressed the barrel of one of her Dualies against Lily's forehead. "Why are you here?"

"... Fine," Lily finally said, and her body slumped in defeat. "I'm *here* to rebuild my life, fuck you very much. Since I was so *rudely* pulled out of my own time. I don't know why I *got* here, though. I honestly don't."

"Why?" The barrel pressed into her forehead more firmly, leaving a mark.

"Because I don't even know *how* I got here. What I do know makes no sense."

"Tell us."

Lily stared up at Pearl with a scowl. "Fell down a ravine, probably to my death, suddenly was above Octo Valley." Her eyes narrowed. "No. Fucking. Sense."

"I'm not sure I believe you... *human*."

"Much as I really despise what you're doing, I've no reason to lie." One brief moment later, she revised: "Not *anymore*."

Pearl slowly, cautiously, eased the Dualie barrel off of Lily's head. "Then turn back. Show me what you really look like."

Lily shook her head. "God damnit Pearl, that's impossible. Humans can't shape-shift." 

"Bullshit! Why are you disguised as an Inkling then?"

"I'm not disguised... I *am* an Inkling now. I thought you would have asked Sheldon that. I heard you had quite the chat with my friends." She sighed. "Cephalopods have been evolving without us for hundreds, thousands, I dunno, millions of years? Your ink as a defense mechanism has a much more violent reaction to humans now. I got changed because I landed in ink."

"That sounds ridiculous."

"I realise. But everything else has evolved with you guys. We haven't."

"And what does this have to do with NILS?"

"...What's NILS? Pardon?"

"Don't be daft! We know you worked with Tartar to try to kill us all and give humans back the world!" 

Lily just stared at her. "...What the *fuck* are you on about, Pearl?! I've no idea what either of those things are! I don't want to destroy---"

"SHUT IT!" Pearl's Dualie muzzles pressed firmly against Lily's head, and the human-Inkling saw the other's fingers rest on the triggers. "That's enough. Ya done, son."

Lily sighed, and closed her eyes. As she waited for Pearl to make a move, almost hoping for Pearl to open fire on her, she wondered what death would feel like...

"Lily! Hang on!"
