DJ_Hyperfresh> Well be sure to give yourself a break, I hear they get sensitive when people play rough with them...
DJ_Hyperfresh> Uh
DJ_Hyperfresh> Ahahaha
DJ_Hyperfresh> Hi there 3!
IAmThree> I won't ask
MC.Princess> I still think you should go with SquidbeakThreek, IAmThree
DJ_Hyperfresh> Yeah Eight got uh... kicked right between the legs today
DJ_Hyperfresh> I'll explain shortly
IAmThree> Oh youch
IAmThree> MC.Princess: I made it my backup username, but it's not really my style
IAmThree> So who's who again?
MC.Princess> Yo it's Pearl!
MC.Princess> Marina is DJ_Hyperfresh, Octagent is Agent 8
MC.Princess> No points for guessing who CraigCuttlefish is
CraigCuttlefish> yes?
MC.Princess> Hey Cap your boy IAmThree is here
CraigCuttlefish> hello again agent 3
DJ_Hyperfresh> Oh no...
DJ_Hyperfresh> Pearl, her phone's locked again.
MC.Princess> Really?! Aw nuts
DJ_Hyperfresh> I guess when the screen turned off it must have auto-locked.
IAmThree> Whose phone?
DJ_Hyperfresh> I'd have to either get her fingerprint again or guess the code. And I've never seen her type in the code.
DJ_Hyperfresh> One sec Three
DJ_Hyperfresh> Remember when you came up to the surface, we mentioned a girl who seemed suspicious?
MC.Princess> SHE'S TOTALLY A HUMAN THREE
MC.Princess> CONFIRMED
CraigCuttlefish> HUMAN???
DJ_Hyperfresh> Aww, I wanted to be the one to tell him...
DJ_Hyperfresh> Are you going to do that every time?
CraigCuttlefish> yes
IAmThree> Holy shit
IAmThree> Are you sure?
MC.Princess> HEARD THE WORDS RIGHT OUT OF HER MOUTH
Octagent> I have hearing of the words too
IAmThree> But the fossils...
DJ_Hyperfresh> Oh no they are totally still extinct
DJ_Hyperfresh> It's some weird time travel thing, seems like.
IAmThree> Soo... are they connected to NILS then?
DJ_Hyperfresh> Well we... haven't been able to prove that yet.
DJ_Hyperfresh> I didn't notice any familiar NILS/Kamabo logos or icons on her phone
IAmThree> They gotta be, right?
IAmThree> A machine created by humans shows up, then an actual human?
MC.Princess> See, me and Three are on the same wavelength
MC.Princess> Can't be a coincidence
DJ_Hyperfresh> I get what you are getting at.
DJ_Hyperfresh> I just have to consider it's possible they don't know each other...
DJ_Hyperfresh> The statue and Tartar has to have been operating since humans went extinct. And we've only been seeing the human herself for like... a month.
DJ_Hyperfresh> MC.Princess: check PMs

* Private message with MC.Princess
DJ_Hyperfresh> Should we mention the Marie thing?
MC.Princess> Uhhhh good question
MC.Princess> With Cap about probably not
MC.Princess> That could cause some big problems
DJ_Hyperfresh> Yeah that might tear him apart... if he thinks his family is working opposite him
DJ_Hyperfresh> Maybe I'll just... not mention it right now.
DJ_Hyperfresh> If it becomes important then yeah but for now...
MC.Princess> Good call
MC.Princess> I'll zip it then

* Now chatting in #MarinasChatroom
IAmThree> So what happened?
MC.Princess> So this ancient car was found on the roof of the New Albacore Hotel right??
DJ_Hyperfresh> Yeah, they're rebuilding the roof to be part of the Turf War circuit, so they can get more traffic and stuff. And then a few weeks ago, news gets out of this vehicle just... sitting on the roof. In the middle of a construction site.
MC.Princess> Totally weird yeah?
DJ_Hyperfresh> They finally got it down off the roof today, so we were there doing a piece on it for the news crew.
MC.Princess> And WHO HAPPENS TO BE IN THE CROWD but the weird girl, and her friend
MC.Princess> And SHELDON
IAmThree> Sheldon's in on this? Wow
MC.Princess> Yeah he knows
MC.Princess> He was also the one who *told us* she was human
DJ_Hyperfresh> So we went in and had a talk with em
DJ_Hyperfresh> And things got kinda... heated
DJ_Hyperfresh> She tried to tell us she studied the human language or something like that.
IAmThree> I don't remember any school offering anything like that
MC.Princess> Yeah they don't
MC.Princess> She was totally making shit up
DJ_Hyperfresh> And then yeah, Sheldon cracked and confirmed it for us, and she ran off.
DJ_Hyperfresh> We caught her not too long ago to ask questions, but another... friend of hers arrived and hauled her off.
MC.Princess> So yeah it's been wild today
DJ_Hyperfresh> A bit of an adventure, yes.
CraigCuttlefish> inklings helping humans? sounds like conspiracy
MC.Princess> Conspiracy adventure? I dig it
IAmThree> What are they actually doing then
MC.Princess> Settling in or some junk SO THEY SAY
MC.Princess> I still think they have something to do with NILS
DJ_Hyperfresh> Well... I've been thinking, after her friend came to rescue her
DJ_Hyperfresh> She did have her first Turf War game today... 
MC.Princess> Yeah and?
DJ_Hyperfresh> Well, like... We haven't seen much from her, she seems like she's making an effort to blend into Inkopolis, right?
DJ_Hyperfresh> Tartar hated our culture entirely, Lily seems at least to be trying to embrace it
MC.Princess> I guess she does have friends in Sheldon and that one girl
CraigCuttlefish> so wait is the human good or not
DJ_Hyperfresh> Uhh... She's not Tartar levels of bad, yet anyway
DJ_Hyperfresh> But I'm not ready to call her 'good' yet... 
DJ_Hyperfresh> I don't think she will want to talk to us anymore after how we handled her though...
MC.Princess> Let's give her some space and see what she gets up to
CraigCuttlefish> I could get agent 1 and 2 on the case if theyre not busy
MC.Princess> Maybe
DJ_Hyperfresh> I dunno... She hasn't *tried* anything yet.
DJ_Hyperfresh> But I'll keep that in mind
MC.Princess> Hey Octagent hasn't posted for a while
MC.Princess> You OK 8??
Octagent> yes
Octagent> screen is moving fast like
Octagent> makes the reading hard
DJ_Hyperfresh> Yeah this is the fastest this chatroom has ever gone!
MC.Princess> We'll keep you guys informed
DJ_Hyperfresh> Yeah as the folks say at work, it's a 'developing story'.
CraigCuttlefish> don't worry eight
CraigCuttlefish> it will die down again soon
Octagent> die?
Octagent> :(
MC.Princess> It just gets quiet sometimes 8
MC.Princess> Thats all he meant
Octagent> ok
