## Metal Bork

The sun was still low over the horizon as Lily and Lorne arrived in Octo Canyon, ready to begin their training. The air was cool was it brushed through the Hideout, and Lily shivered. She couldn't wait to get into that hoodie, and she set her backpack down, kneeling before it to retrieve the gear.

Lorne chuckled. "Hey, this'll be the first time you put the gear on, right? I'm excited for you!" With a grin, she rested a hand on Lily's shoulder as she carefully removed the headset, hoodie, boots and Hero Shot, staring at them in awe.

The gear was a gift from Callie. She had argued to her (in private) that Marie should have granted them to her at the beginning, but, hey, better late than never, right?

As she set the clothing down on the bench and begin to remove her civilian gear, Lorne started to move ahead of her. "Hey, where are you headed?" Lily called after her as she sat down next to the pile of gear and began untying her shoes.

"Prepping your training! Get the headset on - I'll ping you to go to Beaker's in a bit!" Agent 4 descended the ramp past the stone archway and was gone.

Lily watched her leave, then put her head down and quietly thought.

*Twelve thousand years.*

*Twelve thousand years humans had been extinct.*

*Twelve thousand years, at least, that I've been gone.*

It wasn't like she didn't know she was the last human - she had assumed that as soon as she'd stepped into Inkopolis for the first time. But it was the number that put things in perspective.

Twelve thousand years.

If it was something like three *million* years, it just wouldn't have the same impact. But most recorded human history had happened within a three thousand year period. These creatures had had plenty of time since human extinction to evolve themselves and their culture.

*Maybe,* she thought to herself, *this is why it's important I grab this stuff.*

*It's not just about making sure it doesn't fall into the wrong hands anymore.*

*This stuff needs to be preserved. My* knowledge *needs to be preserved.*

She sighed, and pulled the Hero Headset from the neat pile of gear next to her. She examined it, watching the patterns of the pulsing earpieces, but thinking of home. Thinking of the friends she missed. Thinking of her previous life, almost a distant memory.

Lyrics from an old song formed in her mind. Without thinking, 'knowing' she was alone, she let the words come out:

| "*I could never find the right way to tell you*
| *Have you noticed I've been gone?*
| *Because I left behind the home that you made me*
| *But I will carry i---"*

"Oy. Human. You right over there?"

Lily's eyes snapped up, glancing around frantically for the source of the voice. She pulled on the headset and grabbed the Hero Shot from the pile of gear and stood.

The voice had come from just to the left of her, in the formerly-empty space *behind* the grate back to the Square.

A mass of tentacles sat beneath a bulbous head with bulging eyes, making their owner look perpetually angry, even as they eyed her. Atop the creature's head was a very ornate, almost ceremonial headwear.

This creature sat in an octopus-sized snowglobe, taller than she was.

The two watched each other in silence. As Lily watched, Octavio shifted, 'sat up' in his globe, taking interest. 

Lily slowly, cautiously approached the globe, weapon up. From inside the globe, he didn't seem to be able to touch her, despite its condition. "I'm *fine*. And just what makes you think I'm human? They're extinct. Or did you not get the memo?"

The octopus thing scoffed. Lily noticed she couldn't see the thing's mouth behind its 'moustache'. "Fine. '*Formerly* human'. You match the description my scouts gave. 'Long hair, smaller frame, clueless'... About the only thing you're missing is 'buck naked'... unless you want to fix that for me?" Lily could just *feel* the guy's smirk.

"Fuck off." Lily turned and headed back to the bench to pull on the hoodie over her shirt. "I'm not having any of it right now."

She kicked off her Cream Basics, pulling the Hero Boots on carefully and ignoring the octopus in the globe as it watched her. The boots seemed... a bit much. Lily wasn't sure what to make of it. There was more shoe here than seemed necessary, *or* fashionable! Maybe the extra stuff was armor?

She made sure that the boots fit her carefully, then placed them neatly in her backpack. As she did, something clicked in her head about what the creature had said to her.

If these 'scouts' had said she was nude, then they had to have been the same ones that had attacked her at the Hideout when she was but a newly-turned, clueless Inkling.

And if *that* was the case, Callie had said at Agent 4's debriefing that they had been sent by...

Lily turned around, geared up, looking the part of an Agent. "So. *You're* the Octavio I've been hearing about. Been having fun in there?".

The octopus rolled his eyes at her. "Clearly. All alone, trapped in this confined space for days on end? I'm having the time of my *life* here. I'd have at least expected your *friend* to come and gloat. You both look quite alike, you know."

"We've been busy." Lily watched him carefully, noticing out of the corner of her eyes that her tentacles had shifted from its usual blue and had taken on an olive-ish tinge. *Huh, I didn't realise it would do that... I guess it masks my identity a bit...* "Nothing you should worry about."

"You can't get home, can you, human?" Octavio tutted, trying to contort his features into faking something approximating 'worried concern' and failing. "If only you had just let my scouts bring you to me, you'd be *much* happier. You wouldn't need to pretend to be someone else. Our scientists would be much closer to solving your conundrum."

"Who says I want to go back? Who says I am trying to be someone else?" Lily frowned, and checked the headset to make sure it was still on.

"I mean, *really*, who would *willingly* want to hide behind the facade of an Inkling of all things?"

"You say that like I have a choice in the matter." 

"So you don't deny you're human?" Octavio's smirk had returned and taken on a smug quality.

Lily sighed. She knew he knew. "*Formerly*, to use your words. That was my previous life."

"I'm just saying, you could be *more* than you are, even now. I can tell you have so much untapped *power* within you. I could help you realise that potential, human." Octavio still had that sort of 'smirk' vibe about him, but his tone had become more serious.

"Funny. Thinking I have any sort of potential."

"So the confidence could use a touch-up too. *Trust me*," the octopus said to her, easing himself against the glass, eyes focused right on her. "Free me from this prison, and I will show you your true potential. I will guide you, and you will be a force to be reckoned with."

"Sorry, I never let out on the first date." She chuckled at her own dumb play on words, as a series of beeps played on the headset. "One sec," she said to Octavio as she keyed the mic button. "This is Agent 5, come in."

"Oh, don't be so formal!" Lorne's voice came in over the headset. "It's just you and me out here."

"And an octopus you never told me about," Lily added, eyeing him.

"Wha--- Oh! Did I not--- Gah, sorry, Lily... Yeah, that's DJ Octavio, we've been holding him since Callie and the Great Zapfish were rescued. I hope he's not been giving you too much grief..."

"Eh... He's trying to convince me to break him out. Keyword 'trying'."

"Heh, right... Well, anyway, your training is all setup here. Just had to calm your training partner, since Callie isn't here yet."

"Eh? Training partner?"

"Just get over here and I'll show you! Remember, Beaker's Depot, and then head for the boss kettle."

"Wait--- Your idea of training is putting me up against a---?!" She cut herself off, realising she probably shouldn't divulge too much to the guy just in front of her. "Are you crazy?"

"Don't worry, he won't be too rough on you. He agreed to that."

"I'm not convinced..."

"C'moooon. There's a kiss in it for you if you meet me there..."

Lily sighed. "Damn you... I'm on my way."

"Good girl. See you shortly." With a click, the voice of Agent 4 was gone.

Lily sighed, and laughed softly to herself. *Oh, how things are changing quickly between us..* "Looks like I'm headed out," she said to Octavio. "I'll be seeing you around, 'DJ' Octavio."

"You'd better," Octavio grumbled, pretending to be upset. "It's so *boring* without company."

"Noted." She turned, and started to make her way toward the archway. Without looking, she waved at him with her free hand. "See you soon."
