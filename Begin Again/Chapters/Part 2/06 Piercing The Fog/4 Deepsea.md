Somewhere off the coast, hundreds of meters below sea level, on another train, two Inklings sat in a quiet carriage, their only companion at the moment a friendly, sleeping isopod. The lights in the carriage were dimmed as the simulated day cycle had not flicked over to being 'day' yet. As such, only one of the passengers were awake.

One of the inklings, a boy with long, green hair, regarded his surroundings once again as he waited for his phone to ping once more. His mantle was detached and was draped over his front as a makeshift blanket, covering a hi-vis vest. His clothing was odd for down here - then again, Inklings down here were very uncommon - but it wasn't the first thing that jumped out at people that met him down here.

For after an incident not too long ago, his right eye and the skin around it was permanently stained a green-ish blue, contrasting against his regular creamy skin colour. It was an unsightly splotch of colour on an otherwise calm, matured face.

```
DJ_Hyperfresh> Hello everyone, I'm back! I just got into the studio.
MC.Princess> THERE YOU ARE
MC.Princess> Was starting to get concerned they'd abducted you or something
```

The Inkling's phone buzzed as Marina rejoined the chat. Time to find out what was going on.

```
IAmThree> Welcome back
IAmThree> One sec, gotta get the Captain in here
```

Agent 3 stood, stretching his legs and flexing them as he made his way over to the sleeping, elderly Inkling. This one was in a green tracksuit with white stripes down the sides. 

Agent 3 knelt down beside him and rested a hand on his shoulder, gently shaking him. "Good Morning again, sir. Marina's just returned from her talk with the human."

Craig Cuttlefish grumbled and groaned as he stirred from. "And? Why can't you fill me in when I've gotten some proper sleep?"

"I'm making this assumption based on context but... it sounded like her and her friend were hired as Agents Four and Five. I figured you would have some questions."

One of Craig's eyes opened and examined Three. With a sigh and a grumble of "What are my granddaughters up to up there..." he sat up and stretched, reaching for his phone. "Alright Three, let's see what's good."

```
* CraigCuttlefish has joined the chatroom
IAmThree> There we go
DJ_Hyperfresh> Alright then. So...
DJ_Hyperfresh> I'll just tell the story again for Pearlie and Craig.
DJ_Hyperfresh> I've been on my train in to work
DJ_Hyperfresh> I'm there earlier than usual since the tech crew is installing a crowd cam for the Splatfest events and I volunteered to help. Got to setup a discreet mount to catch as much of the Square as we can.
DJ_Hyperfresh> Anyway, Lily and her friend are heading in at the same time, see me on the train and invite me to chat.
DJ_Hyperfresh> Hooo boy. I learned two important points from that conversation.
CraigCuttlefish> is what 3 is telling me about a 4 and 5 true
DJ_Hyperfresh> I... was hoping you would confirm that for me. I only have their word. 
DJ_Hyperfresh> Though I did see they had headphones like 3 does.
DJ_Hyperfresh> You do keep files on your agents yeah?
MC.Princess> Hang on what
MC.Princess> Like agents 4 and 5? What are you talking about
DJ_Hyperfresh> Well I wanna make sure it's real before I just start saying it as fact.
DJ_Hyperfresh> In the meantime, the other thing was that I can now confirm that Lily had no knowledge of Tartar or his work, nor was involved.
DJ_Hyperfresh> Though it's possible she might have still been manipulated without her or our knowledge...
```

"Well I'll be..."

Three looked up from his phone. "Is it true?"

Craig glanced at him. "Seems to be. I created a file on the human a while back for One and Two to keep an eye out, but, yes, they seem to have updated it recently and created their own for an Agent 4. One second and I'll post Lily's file up. Might need to redact some things."

```
IAmThree> Well that sounds good at least
IAmThree> I'd still like to have *words* with her about my eye though
MC.Princess> ...Not really on his side? That still seems hard to believe
DJ_Hyperfresh> I know, but, the discussion we had has led me to that conclusion.
DJ_Hyperfresh> What she's been *doing*, I don't know yet, but we'll be planning a proper meeting to talk properly soon.
DJ_Hyperfresh> One that I'll make sure you're part of, Pearl. She promised us that under agreement that we don't mention her on the news anymore
MC.Princess> Awww but...
IAmThree> FYI - Cap's just confirmed the info, he'll be posting up Lily's file shortly, Agents 1 and 2 seem to have updated it
DJ_Hyperfresh> Well then...
DJ_Hyperfresh> Alright. MC.Princess: Lily and her friend were just confirmed for being Agents 4 and 5.
MC.Princess> ...
MC.Princess> ARE YOU SQUIDDING ME
MC.Princess> Even if she wasn't involved with that dumb telephone, what could she be doing for you guys??
IAmThree> Should say in the file he's preparing, but her friend - Agent 4 - recently recovered the Great Zapfish from DJ Octavio and rescued Callie, apparently...
IAmThree> Sounds familiar... half of it...
MC.Princess> Wait huh??? I thought Zappy just... took a break
DJ_Hyperfresh> That lines up, Three. We reported on both their disappearances a couple weeks ago...
DJ_Hyperfresh> Octavio huh? I thought after the last time, he'd've figured not to steal a major power source from a species that could fight back...
DJ_Hyperfresh> And that *would* explain the comment I got from Marie a few days back if he was recently acti--- 
MC.Princess> ...Marina?
MC.Princess> MARINA YO ARE YOU OKAY
DJ_Hyperfresh> I'm fine, Pearlie!
DJ_Hyperfresh> ...Hey Caaaaap...
DJ_Hyperfresh> Are your granddaughters... involved in your operation at all...?
CraigCuttlefish> this is Lily, the human girl
```

Almost identical to Agent 4 as a result * Possible connection to Commander Tartar, both became active at the same time * Possibly seeks to complete Tartar's goal of worldwide elimination??? * Connection to Sheldon (Ammo Knights) and at least one inkling (A1 comment: Agent 4) * Pre-inkling life: cleaner, food production worker, mashup artist, computer nerd, music enthusiast * Currently sharing residence with Agent 4 (A1 comment: maybe romantically involved?)  ||

```
DJ_Hyperfresh> Yep, that's her...
CraigCuttlefish> DJ_Hyperfresh yes. 1 and 2 
MC.Princess> 'age 26' Wow what an old fart 
DJ_Hyperfresh> I wonder if human years are different to our years, like otherwise they'd be eight years older than me and they don't... seem it, mentally.
MC.Princess> 'Originally a human male' OH MY COD THAT EXPLAINS A BIT??? I always wondered why she seemed to carry herself differently to other girls 
MC.Princess> I mean, even before the human discovery 
DJ_Hyperfresh> That's certainly an... interesting point. So not just changing species, but changing gender too?
IAmThree> 'Artifact retrieval' huh? What's that involve...
DJ_Hyperfresh> Oh I think I know, actually! About the time she started showing up, this weird shower of... things happened across Inkopolis and beyond, including a phone right through our window, and that car.
DJ_Hyperfresh> And we saw her get the phone, and she was around the car when it got brought down... it would make sense if she was going around collecting everything.
MC.Princess> So hey is everything she's collecting *her* things or just *human* things?
DJ_Hyperfresh> I haven't figured that out for sure yet, but I'm guessing it's all hers.
DJ_Hyperfresh> I mean, maybe she's collecting all that stuff just as her mission, but she seemed at least pretty invested in that phone and the laptop. And the car...
DJ_Hyperfresh> ...Hey, one of us is gonna need to tell Agent 8...
```

"Agent 3?"

"Yessir?" Three looked up from the phone, hand now resting over his mouth, in thought.

"Schedule us a stop at the Central Station. I think we will need to head back up to the surface and get to the bottom of this ourselves."

Three blinked. "As... as you wish, sir." He pulled out an odd remote-looking device from a pocket on the hi-vis jacket, and clicked in the analog stick on it. "We testing your theory today?"

"We sure are. Let's see if there's any merit to it."

A screen materialized in front of him, with a complete map of the Metro facility open. This isn't what Three wanted though, so he clicked onto the next tab, where the train lines were visible. His cursor moved over to the point in the middle of the map, the Central Station, and clicked on it. It pinged, and an ETA indicator arrived. One hour to wait, to get from the outer edges of the map where the train was currently moving, back to the central line. Three could deal with that.

The only issue was, the path they had taken through the NILS Statue to get back to the Metro was one they could not use anymore. The main elevator into the depths of the statue had been destroyed by Pearl's Killer Wail a week ago, and while they had been able to descend with climbing rope, it had been carefully hung from Off the Hook's heli and then retrieved. But the Captain suspected there may be another way back to civilization, and his suspicion was about the abandoned station where he and Agent 8 had awoken. What lay beyond...?

```
CraigCuttlefish> we're coming up
DJ_Hyperfresh> Up...?
DJ_Hyperfresh> Wait, up? To the surface? Now?!
IAmThree> Cap's decided this situation needs his personal intervention
IAmThree> I mean it'll be a while to get 'up' anywhere, we won't be able to get back up the statue way but we're hoping there'll be another way up somewhere in the Metro itself
DJ_Hyperfresh> Oh... okay. Just, uh, keep us informed I guess, and please give us plenty of warning if you need us to pick you up!
MC.Princess> Statue's a no-go then?
IAmThree> Too tough to organise any kind of rope ascent, elevator's gone, no super jump points
IAmThree> The final ladder to the surface is still there, but that's... kind of it in terms of climbing.
DJ_Hyperfresh> I don't know if this means much, Three, but if you can't find anything... there's an Octarian story about a town that was sealed off after something breached its cave's walls... due to the residents being killed or abducted and turned 'evil'.
DJ_Hyperfresh> I know it sounds weird, but if it's real, through a certain interpretation I could see that being something to do with the undead Octarians, hence the Metro broke into Octopia somewhere...
IAmThree> Hmm... Worth a thought
IAmThree> I suppose if we can find something like that, it would be *a* way to get home, a very roundabout one but...
IAmThree> We'll keep in touch
DJ_Hyperfresh> Sure. Stay safe Three, Cap!

The Deepsea Metro train continued speeding along, slowly calculating its route towards Central Station.
