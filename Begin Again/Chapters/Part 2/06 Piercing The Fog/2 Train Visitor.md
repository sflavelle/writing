*"Now arriving into: Inkopolis West. This service is now entering the City Loop."*

Marina stared at the laptop screen in front of her as her train paused at another station, on her trip from Pearl's home into the Square. Her chatroom sat, downsized in one corner of the screen, a document full of notes in the other.

She heard a rapping on the window beside her, surprising her. She turned her head to see what had caused the noise.

It was *Lily*. And her friend. They were both carrying backpacks over their shoulders. They must have been boarding the train and had seen her.

*Oh, right! I guess she does take my train - after all, there was the other time with Sheldon when...*

Lily seemed to sigh. Then she pointed at Marina toward the back of the train, and started to walk off. 

Marina stared after her, then, remembering the chatroom, shot off a quick message to Three, shoved the laptop into her bag, and walked over to the door into the carriage.

```
DJ_Hyperfresh> One sec - Lily is getting on my train.
```

Marina met the two girls as they had got on and were headed back through the next carriage. Lily eyed her as they kept moving. "The rear carriage was empty. We'll be down there if you want us."

She stared after the girls as they moved on, considering the offer. *Were... Did they want to chat?*

Taking her seat again briefly, she whipped out the laptop again and checked the chat.

```
IAmThree> Uh oh
IAmThree> Are you alright, Marina?
DJ_Hyperfresh> I'm fine - I... think she and her friend want to talk to me about something.
DJ_Hyperfresh> Considering Pearl called her out on our Sunday broadcast I'm guessing it's to do with that... but who knows...
DJ_Hyperfresh> I'm going to go and talk with them - sounds like they found an empty carriage on this train we can talk openly in. Don't worry if I don't respond - I will probably be engaged for a while. I'll check back in when it's over.
IAmThree> Alright. Be careful...
DJ_Hyperfresh> Will do. I'll just go message Pearl to get on here first.
```

The laptop went away and, before she stood up to go see what the girls wanted, she pulled her phone from her pocket and went into her messages. She knew Pearl would be awake by now - she would be making breakfast. She typed out a quick message. *'Hey - Lily on my train - wants to talk - get in chatroom, will update everyone there.'*

Then she opened the voice recorder and started recording, moved the phone to another pocket on her jacket, then stood up, making sure she had everything, and made her way down toward the back of the train.
