DJ_Hyperfresh> Good morning everyone! Who's awake?
DJ_Hyperfresh> ...No one? Hm...
IAmThree> Good morning Marina
IAmThree> You're up rather early
DJ_Hyperfresh> Hi there Three! Speak for yourself.
IAmThree> Time doesn't *really* matter down here...
IAmThree> But me and Cap are taking shifts watching over the Metro train
IAmThree> There's not a whole lot of light outside the train with power knocked out, and we don't quite know what else is or isn't running
IAmThree> Or what could escape its confines... ahem, the freaky lifeless Octarians
DJ_Hyperfresh> I see... Do try to stay safe though!
DJ_Hyperfresh> My life is... not as interesting. I'm on my way into work to help out some of the techs install stuff.
DJ_Hyperfresh> Did you check out Inkopolis Square when you were up here?
IAmThree> Briefly. Still partial to the Plaza though
DJ_Hyperfresh> Well, there's a concert stage that we put up above the Deca Tower entrance for the Splatfest, but we want to include a 'crowd cam' for future Splatfest events, and we want to make sure it's placed discreetly so not a lot of people can notice it or block it.
