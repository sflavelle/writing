Marina stepped into the rear carriage of the train, cautious. As they had said, as the train trundled along, this one was near empty.

Except for two people.

They were sat in the far corner of the train, on a four-seater cube. The both of them were in one side, Lily looking over her friend's shoulder at her phone.

*Oh, right... we still have her phones back at the mansion. Better message Pearl to bring them in later...*

She approached them carefully, and took her seat opposite them, legs spread outward, and leaning forward, elbows resting on her thighs, hands clasped together. "So," she said with a sigh. "Is this about the broadcast on Sunday?"

Lily glanced at her, and sat up. "Well, it's about... everything, but yeah, let's start with that."

"Listen, I wanted to avoid starting any more---"

"I know," her friend replied, putting her phone away. "Even if Lily did... freak out over being named at the time..."

"That's putting it mildly," Lily mumbled.

"She would at least agree with me that you were doing what you could to avoid getting people on a witch hunt for her. I get the impression that you're softening on her. That's why we're approaching you and not Pearl. We feel like you'd listen to what we have to say."

"So here's our deal." Lily sat forward. "This is all off the record. I don't need a profile piece. I don't need to be put in the spotlight anymore than I already am. I need information. Context. But, in exchange, let's organise to meet up somewhere and... we'll answer as much as we can about... me. I don't want to be the enemy, Marina."

Marina sat back, in thought. "Why? After everything that's already happened, why now?"

"Two reasons." Lily held up two digits to emphasize. "One: As just mentioned. I don't want to be your enemy. I don't want to be *anyone's* enemy. I grew up with the mindset 'treat others how you would want to be treated'. Life's too short to worry about hating anyone I interact with, or would want to interact with. So I just would feel better about myself if I managed to at least get ourselves to the point of being, I dunno, friendly acquaintances." She sighed, and thought for a moment. "Or, even if we never spoke again, it would just be nice if life got back to a point where I didn't have to fear for mine."

Marina nodded slowly. "Mm. And the second reason?"

Lily took a deep breath. This was the important one for her, Marina assumed. "There are two things that have kept being brought up since the Hotel, and I still haven't heard anyone explain to me what they are. I've been associated with someone or something, and I don't know why."

Marina nodded again, understanding. "You want to know about Commander Tartar."

Lily blinked. "*Commander*? ...Yes, I want to know about them."

The Octoling girl took a few breaths as she worked out how to best explain. She reached for her bag and pulled out the laptop, keeping its screen turned toward her. Pretending to look up notes, she checked on the chatroom. "Well... Tartar... He is... *Was...* an AI created by humans before they went extinct. I guess he was built by some group called NILS. His goal was to pass on humanity's knowledge to the next true sapient species, or something like that."

"Seems noble enough so far. Up until I left, we were always fascinated with the idea of intelligent life somewhere out there in the universe."

"Did you discover any?"

"Not that I know of, sadly."

"Well, Tartar did not end up being... quite as benevolent." She sighed, recalling all the video calls and chats from the past two months. "He posed as this... guide, of sorts. 'Just bring me the four Thangs, and I can show you the promised land', he said. That required Eight going through all sorts of---"

"'Eight'?" Lily's friend's brow furrowed, and the two Inklings exchanged glances. "Who's 'Eight'?"

"Huh? Oh--- uh... The boy you've probably seen around us lately. Lily would know him. That's uh... our... nickname for him..."

Lily grumbled a quiet '*yeah, I know 'im*'. Marina glanced away, out the window. "Sorry. But, yes... Then he revealed his true colours, tried to *blend up our friends -* good thing Agent 3 broke them out - and then he---"

"Agent 3?!" Lorne shouted. "Like, 'New Squidbeak Splatoon' Agent 3?!"

"Quiet!" Marina hissed, and looked around to make sure anyone that might have entered the carriage hadn't heard. "I'm only telling you because it's important you know every---" The Octoling froze. *Hang on a second...* "How... do you know about the *New* Squidbeak Splatoon?"

Lily looked over at her friend, concerned, awaiting a convincing explanation.

The other Inkling paused, considering her options, then deliberately reached for her bag, turned to Lily, and nodded, before opening the pack and reaching inside.

"What? Here? Now?"

"May as well," came her friend's reply. Lily just stared for a moment, then nodded back and reached for her own bag.

"Uh--- hang on---" Marina was worried now. Had she stepped too far? What were these girls going to do to---

Both girls pulled an item from their packs. The same item.

They both held a pair of headphones, that wrapped around the back of the head. The conical earpieces glittered and pulsed with digital light patterns.

*They were the same headphones Agent 3 wore,* Marina realised.

Then a further realisation struck her: *But that must mean they're---*

The headphones went back in their bags, and the bags went back on the floor. 

"Oh, fuck," Marina mouthed, not meaning to say it aloud. "I, uhm, I'm---"

"I'm Agent Four," Lorne said, gesturing to herself. Then, pointing at Lily, she simply said, "She's Five." She leaned forward. "How do \*you\* know about them?"

"We, uh..." Marina stuttered lightly, processing what she had just been shown. "We... Me and Pearl stumbled upon them. We discovered Captain Cuttlefish and Agent 3's distress signal a few months ago. They were stuck underground, and... me and Pearl helped them out. We've... been in contact since."

with a grim smile Lorne said, "So that explains where they went." Glancing at Marina, she said, more seriously, "Does that mean your 'Eight' is...?"

Marina sighed. "...Yes. Agent 8."

Lily nodded, and sighed deeply, remembering the sewer encounter. "Well, that's gonna be a problem. But alright. So, your... *our* friends nearly got blended."

"Huh? Oh, right..." Pretending to consult notes again, Marina shot off a quick message to the chatroom: 'Is anyone awake that can confirm the existence of an Agent 4 or 5???' Hitting the send button, she straightened up. "Anyway, yeah, Tartar revealed his true colors, went on some monologue - I remember the gist being that neither Inklings or Octolings were 'worthy' species because we, err, we fought over little things - like, the splatfests and things - and also something about our taste in fashion?"

"Oh, that's *rich.*" Lily laughed, thinking it absurd.

"Lily...?" Lorne was looking at her with an odd expression.

"We are guilty of the exact same shit!" Lily pointed at herself. "We've *done* that! He's a fuckin' hypocrite!"

"...Pardon?" Lorne looked at her quizically, concerned. Marina had a similar look.

"I'm not going to tell you that humans as a whole were great people," Lily said. "They had a capacity for greatness and kindness, just like you. In fact just about all of the people I miss from my world, had the wellbeing of their friends and even strangers in mind in day to day life." She paused, adding as an afterthought, "Probably exaggerating a bit."

After a moment to take a breath, she continued: "But humans as a species, holy shit... we hated each other for anything you could think of. The color of the skin, the people we loved, the cause we believed in, the clothes we wore, just... anything."

"This is sounding familiar," Marina realised. "He was going to wipe us out for that very problem."

"Again, he would have known. We fought, we killed. We destroyed entire cultures, species and civilizations just so we didn't have to change our own ways. It was easier to make the rich richer than to save the lives of millions. We have no place in the world of today. We do deserve to be extinct."

Marina stared at her for a moment. "I... guess you've got a bit of a bone to pick with humans, huh?"

Lily sighed, and threw her hands up. "Yeah... but I'm sorry, I really shouldn't be going off on a tirade. You were saying...?"

"Man... one sec, lemme remember what I was up to." Marina adjusted herself in her seat, glancing at her notes again. "Oh, okay... he... very nearly fired this beam that would have destroyed Inkopolis and... made us all extinct. We only barely stopped him, thanks to Pearl..." She said the last part quietly, looking down. 

"...I see..." Lily thought deeply, leaning forward, face half-buried in her hands. "So then... everything you guys had been saying is true. And then I come along, wrong place wrong time... I... get it. Fuck, man..."

Lorne leaned over to her, resting an arm around her shoulders.

The three girls were silent for a few minutes as the train got closer to the Square, passing through dark underground tunnels as it entered the City Loop.

Lily finally looked up. "Where... is he now? Is he... dead...?"

"He's...not, but... he's separated from that facility that gave him that power. There's a spot in the forests outside Inkopolis that we chose to leave him. He's not a threat anymore."

"That's... generous, after what you've just told us," Lorne pointed out with a raised eyebrow.

"Mmm. We considered it but... honestly, Three brought up the idea. Why not force him to keep on living in our world, if he hates it so much." She snorted, smirking slightly, and Lily allowed a dark smile and nod.

The carriage fell into silence again. Marina thought back over the conversation that had just happened. "So... you really didn't know about Tartar *or* NILS then."

Lily sighed, and shook her head. "I told you. But y'all were set on this weird... revenge thing."

"Lily, please... understand how we saw all this happening. These things fall from the sky. We start seeing you, *with* these things that nobody else can read. Then Tartar reveals himself, with a human statue, and created by some professor at least 12,000 years ago when humans died out. Then, well, that stuff at the hotel happe--- Lily?" 

Lily's hands were over her mouth, and her gaze dropped down to the ground.

*Twelve thousand years. At least.*

*At **least**.*

The train's PA announced that it was pulling into Inkopolis Square, putting a halt to their conversation, and the three of them stood and made their way to the doors, Lily walking slowly, deep in thought.

"I guess we'll have to continue this another time," Marina said as they waited for the train to stop. "Lily, Pearl is bringing in your phones today. Come by the studio later when you're done doing..." She eyed the girls' backpacks. "...whatever you're doing, and we'll hand them over.'

Lily nodded, bringing herself back to the present, having been distracted by her thoughts. "I... guess I can pass on some contact details then so we can organise this meeting."

The doors opened, and the three of them disembarked, heading towards the exit from the underground station that would lead them into the Square proper.

They reached the studio door, and Marina turned toward it. “Well uh… I guess… I'll see you two around, huh?”

Lorne sighed and glanced between her and Lily. “Yeah, guess you will. We're keeping quiet about this, yeah?”

Marina nodded. “I can keep a secret. Though you do realise, I will have to inform Pearl, Cra— the Captain, and Three that we met.”

“…Yeah, I realise. It's probably better they know we at least made contact.”

Marina nodded, and the three stood awkwardly for a few moments. Then finally, Marina turned toward the door again, and unlocked it, making to step inside. “Well… see you soon, then.”

“See you, Marina,” Lily said with a nod. “I'm glad we got the chance to talk.” But as soon as Marina had stepped inside and shut the door, Lily doubled over, hands over her mouth. “Jesus Christ, twelve thousand fucking years... Fuuuuck...”
