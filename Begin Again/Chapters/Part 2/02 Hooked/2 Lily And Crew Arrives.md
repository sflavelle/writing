As Marina and the Inkopolis News field crew finalised the last few details, Lily and Lorne, Roller having tagged along, were arriving at the scene, having caught a tram from a stop nearby the MakoMart. 

"This is more of a crowd than I was expecting," Lily said, scratching at the back of her head.

"But still pretty small," Lorne nudged her. "Should be relatively easy to find him. Come on, you two."

They took a walk around the crowd to see if they could spot their friend. Eventually it was Roller who called, "Oh hey, is that Sheldon and Pearl over there?"

Lorne looked in the direction of his pointing finger and indeed saw him, the trio having walked around to near the front and seeing the two chatting between a barrier. "Yes! Nice work." The girls started walking over to him, Roller following sheepishly.

"Hey, we made it!" Lily called over to Sheldon as they gently made their way through the crowd to him, causing him to turn in their direction. Pearl had also glanced over at them and struck a pose, but looked rather unimpressed when she saw Lily.

"Ah, hello girls!" Sheldon nodded respectfully. "I see you've brought along a friend?"

"Yeah," Lorne nodded, gesturing to Roller. "We just got off of Lily's first Turf War game, and one of our teammates wanted to come take a look too."

"I see! Well, welcome to the fun!" Sheldon smiled over at Roller, turning back towards the suspended car. "As Miss Pearl tells me, they should be allowing the public to get in closer once it's all been signed off by the construction crew and news team."

"Told ya not to call me that, Sheldon," Pearl butted in, from the other side of the barrier. "It's just 'Pearl', none of this 'Miss' crap." She almost seemed to forget about responding to the rest of the comment, and quickly jumped in again, "but yeah, once they get done with it they'll open it up to the people."

"Oh, cool," Lily said absent-mindedly. She was also looking over at the car now and, though it was still a bit above them, about three stories up, she'd caught sight of the licence plate as the car rotated around. It was definitely her car. Wow, what a sight, she thought to herself.

The four of them hung out and chatted about their recent battle while the crews went about their business. Pearl, letting herself be excluded from the conversation for a bit, turned to watch her partner in crime at work. She knew Marina didn't handle too well in front of a crowd, when she wasn't performing, but she was just killing it at the moment.

The car's tires finally touched the ground and a trades-squid leapt up onto the vehicle to disconnect the harness holding it to the crane's hook, and as soon as it was free, they waved the news crew over and another tradesperson, wearing a hi-vis vest, pressed a set of keys into Marina's open palm.

Now that it was down on the ground and in front of them, Lily was surprised to see that even Marina wasn't taller than the roof of the vehicle, as they unlocked and opened the right-hand driver's side door. The Octoling idol gestured the camera crew closer as she climbed into the seat, pointing at and talking about the archaic driving technology inside.

Lily, gathered behind the fence with the others, bit her lip and tried not to let it get to her that these people were poking around her Ford. She also really wanted to talk about the car to Lorne and Sheldon, but knew she shouldn't... Not around all these people, anyway. 

So she waited and listened as the news crew did their thing, as the tradespeople worked around them making the area safe for the general public.
