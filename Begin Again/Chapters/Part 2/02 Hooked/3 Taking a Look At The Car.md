Finally, though, Marina had signed off on her segment and, as the rest of the crew pulled back to their truck on the opposite end of the Hotel's entrance, the vehicle was deemed safe for public inspection.

"Alright! Well, shall we go take a closer look, folks?" Sheldon gestured as the barrier between them and the car was removed. Lily excitedly nodded and Lorne and Roller followed behind them. Pearl, waving them off, jogged over to Marina to speak privately as soon as they were past.

"Oh man, I missed Greenie," Lily finally said once they grouped up by the bonnet of the car. "I forgot that I'm smaller now though, this thing is huge."

Lorne coughed, and cocked her head over in Roller's direction. *Oh right*, Lily realised. "...compared to our cars," she hastily added.

Roller, however was looking through the driver's side window. "This car has seen better days," he commented on the torn fabric of the seats.

"Yeah really," came Marina's voice from behind the group. She and Pearl had walked over to them. "It's old, sure, but it hasn't been looked after very well."

Lily tried not to look too annoyed at the comment, but Pearl noticed her trying to keep her face straight and smirked. "Yo, newbie," she said with a devilish grin. "We've seen you around a bit lately. Why only Turf War now?"

Lily shrugged. "Wasn't a priority. I wanted to try to make ends meet in other ways first."

"Hey," Sheldon called from the front absent-mindedly. He was glancing at the licence plate. "What's this say?"

Lily replied back automatically, "Oh it's just like, letters and numbers and then underneath it says 'Victoria the something state'. 'Education' I think? I forget if--"

Lorne nudged Lily hard in the side to shut her up, and Off the Hook exchanged looks as lily looked over at her friend.

"*Rrreeaaally*?" Pearl finally said, looking a little scary real suddenly, while Marina looked more distraught, hand over her mouth. "How fascinating. And just how do you know that?"

"Huh?" Lily was confused for a brief moment, before realising she had just translated the text for them. Or rather, she'd remembered what it had said. "Oh, uh- I studied exotic languages back in university. That... script belongs to one of those languages that I learned."

Marina mumbled something quietly through her hands.

"Pardon?"

"You haven't even seen the licence plate, you little shit!" Pearl barked at her, stepping towards Lily, causing her to back up against the vehicle.

"Pearl! Language!" admonished Sheldon.

"No way! Ive got words for you too, crab boy!" She pointed a finger accusingly at the Inkling girl, and Lily's heart sank as she realised that she'd fucked up. "That phone! You got it from him, didn't you?"

"...No, I got it from the store like everyone else..."

"Not that one, this!" Pearl launched herself at Lily and both of them tumbled to the ground.

"What's gotten into you today?!" Sheldon rushed over and tugged at the back of Pearl's outfit, pulling her off.

But Pearl was holding something she'd pulled from Lily's pocket. Something glassy and white.

The iPhone.

She whipped around to Sheldon. "We gave this to you to translate! Why's she had it since?!"

"Because she could help me translate from human to---"

Sheldon's eyes went wide, and his mouth snapped shut.

But it was too late. The group around him had heard.

Silence. Uncomfortable silence.

"Excuse me," said a female crustacean to Lily, still pressed against the driver's side door, and everyone either jumped or snapped into a fake cheery expression. It seemed their conversation was either not being heard or was being ignored. "Do you mind if we take a look at the driver's seat?"

"O-oh, not at all!" Lily pushed herself off of the door, and the group as a whole stepped aside. "It's very fascinating stuff."
