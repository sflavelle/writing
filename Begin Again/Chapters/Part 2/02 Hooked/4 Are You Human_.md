Once they were all a safe distance away from the public, in an alleyway on the side of the hotel, Lily caught her breath and tried to be respectful, feeling flustered. Lorne and Roller stood just outside the four-person circle that had formed between Pearl, Marina, Lily and Sheldon, shifting uncomfortably. "Look, yes, 'human' is one of the languages I studied. I've been using that phone alongside my regular phone to, uh... work out what humans back in the day were like. And grab stuff for Sheldon's translator."

Marina sighed exasperatedly. "And that'd be all well and good, if not for the fact that nobody in the world has completely deciphered the human language. Except for you. You're making all this up to try to blend in."

Lily's gaze dropped, and she stayed silent this time. 

More silence. Lorne looked over to Roller. He was definitely paying attention this time, and his mouth was slightly ajar as if he was starting to realise just what Off the Hook was implying about this girl he'd only just met.

"Let me be blunt," Marina said finally, a very serious look on her face, arms crossed. "Are you human?"

"...Well that's just ridiculous," Lily said weakly, gesturing at her very-much-cephalopod body. "I've never... read anything about any human that could shape-shift."

"Really, girls..." Sheldon was starting to have had enough. "I don't understand what this is all about--"

"They're fuckin' deadly, Sheldon!" Pearl said, as if Sheldon should have known this all along. "They tried to wipe out everyone!"

"I've never heard anything about that," said Sheldon flatly, briefly glancing in Lily's direction.

Lily nodded, and glanced over at Lorne and Roller. Lorne raised an eyebrow. Roller just stared at her.

Sheldon continued, "Again, I don't get why you're so set on this. I've interacted with Lily quite frequently these past few weeks as she's settled into the city and---"

"IS SHE HUMAN?!" Pearl barked at him, clearly very frustrated at the fact that nobody else was apparently seeing this as a problem. Her fists were clenched and her body language gave the impression she was aching to start manhandling the two.

"No!" Sheldon said firmly. "Not anymore. Now drop it, both of you!"

But nobody heard the last sentence.

Marina gasped in shock, one hand over her mouth again, the other clenched into a fist. Pearl's mouth just hung open.

Lorne's hands were also over her mouth, in disappointment. Roller was in genuine shock.

Lily felt the color drain from her face. Within seconds, the world around her felt cold and alien to her again. She had to get out of here. Her eyes darted about for any avenue of escape.

And so, without thinking, she pushed off the wall, past the two girls, nearly knocking them over, and took off sprinting down the alleyway, past the crowd gathered around the car.

"HEY!" Pearl yelled after her. Marina immediately took off after the escaping Lily, and her partner called, "Get Eight and kick her ass!"

"On it! Loop me in!" Marina called back, and she was gone.

Pearl sighed. Feeling in her pocket for her radio, locking down the transmit button discreetly, she turned back to the horseshoe crab and the two Inklings. "Sheldon..." she started. "Do you realise now what you've done? You've doomed us all."

"I..." Sheldon let himself trail off. His eyes met Lorne's briefly, and then darted down to the ground.
