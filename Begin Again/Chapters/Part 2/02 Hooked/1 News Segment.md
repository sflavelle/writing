## Hooked

Marina was a little surprised to see the small crowd gathered around the concrete barriers that marked the planned drop point for the vehicle, as she was being miked up and made-up for her camera segment on the event. True, the news team had been tracking this, and news over the past month, even as she and Pearl took the occasional day off for their careers, or, in the most recent instance... 

She glanced over at Pearl, who was making small talk with Sheldon, part of the crowd. Somewhere in the mass of people, she knew their newest friend was hanging about somewhere. Hoping he was coping alright, she let her mind drift back to the task at hand. 

"Alright, Marina, you're ready to go," said the crew's make-up artist, putting away their kit.

"Thanks," Marina nodded and smiled, android got to her feet. "How long until it lands?" She addressed the crew around her. "We ought to time it so we can get in up close before we sign off here."

A shorter inkling boy in a "Staff Technician" shirt had the answer. "Talked to construction a few minutes ago. They reckon about three minutes from now?"

The Octoling did the math. "So let's say it takes about a minute and a half to run through the prepared part of our script. Why don't we roll in about two minutes, and hopefully once we're done with that they should be ready for us to move in and take a closer look."
