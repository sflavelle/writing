An hour and a half passed of walking through the sewers. Lily had begun to realise just how large of a city Inkopolis was.

Finally she started to hear music filtering down from a grate up ahead. She was approaching the Square from underneath! From here she recognised the way to Octo Valley, and the Tentakeel Hideout. She let out a sigh of relief. She was almost there.

Then something dropped from through the grate above. It didn't look like a squid... 

But then it reformed and, in the light from the surface, Lily could see exactly what it was and her heart sank.

Marina was stood in front of her.

She started to walk towards Lily, and the scared inkling turned to flee.

Only to run right into the Octo boy. 

They struggled briefly, but he quickly had her under his control. One arm tightly around her neck. The other gripping her hands behind her back.

Marina began to walk up to them. "Good work, Eight. You've still got it, I see."

Lily looked about frantically at the both of them. "L-look, okay, yes, I'm... the 'h' word," she said in a hushed voice, glancing about for anyone that might be watching, though they were alone. "But I'm not affiliated with anyone, not evil, I've honestly no idea who this Tartar guy is that you think I'm striving to emulate or something." She thought they might have interrupted her by now, but they didn't. "I didn't even mean to get here, but since I'm in your world now... I'm just trying to make a life out of nothing. Honest."

Marina frowned. She had taken something out of her pocket and lobbed it in the boy's direction. Briefly, he took his arm away from Lily's neck to grab the device, activate it and swiftly place it on Lily's back where she would not be able to reach. It emitted ultra-low frequency rumblings that vibrated throughout her entire form. It felt uncomfortable...

"G-gghh," Lily 'said', teeth clenched. "The hell is that?"

"Disruptor," said the boy. You will not getting away of this."

"Did... did neither of you listen to me?" Lily started to struggle again, but Agent 8 was trained, and his grip was tight.

"What have you done to Sheldon and the girl?" Marina asked sharply. "Can it be reversed?"

"I've not... done anything to them! Ugh!" Lily grunted as Eight's arm was back around her neck. Drawing in air as best she could, she continued, "I've just been as much of myself as I /can/ be in my situation. You've obviously talked to them, you know they're--- fine! Hey--- you're--- choking---me!" She started to struggle more as Eight tightened his grip, trying to draw in more breath, but he wouldn't budge. 

Since her legs were unrestrained and he wasn't giving her an inch, she decided that she had to take action. With an "I'm sorry" to Marina, she swiftly swung her leg up behind her, crashing her foot into the boy's crotch. He howled in pain and reflexively let go. 

They both collapsed to the ground, Lily on her knees as she drew a few deep breaths. She looked up briefly, to see Marina rushing up at her. She pushed herself to the side, up against the wall as she passed. As Marina ran past her, head turning to see what the squid was up to, Lily lashed out with her leg again and caught Marina, causing her to trip and tumble over Eight. 

They were both dazed for a moment. Lily slowly got up, still catching her breath. "Look," she said eventually, taking a few steps back. "I'm sorry about that. I genuinely wish I didn't need to defend myself against you. You especially, Marina." She sighed. "But I can see my continued presence in Inkopolis is going to cause problems. And I value my life, at least a little. So if it's all the same to you, I'll be leaving. You'll not have to see me again." She turned and ran for the inkline past the Square grate that would take her to Tentakeel, away from this madness.

"Aaaand..." An unknown voice from somewhere. Lily whipped her head around, trying to find the source as she ran underneath the grate. 

"BOOYAH!" 

A foot connected hard against Lily's head, and it snapped backwards. Lily was reeling in an instant.

But then the weight of an Inkling crashed down on her, and she was knocked to the ground. She was out cold.

Pearl was in the house.

She'd dropped in, literally.
