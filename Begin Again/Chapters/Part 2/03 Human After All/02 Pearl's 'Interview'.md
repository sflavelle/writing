Marina kept walking around to the end of the block and rounded the corner, leaving Agent 8 alone to listen to Pearl at work. She'd finished having a go at Sheldon and had now moved onto two squids, apparently friends of the fugitive.

"You. Boy. What's your name?"

"Uh... Roller."

"How long have you known the human?"

"L-less than an hour really. I was on their team at Makomart..."

"And you didn't notice anything weird about them?"

"Not until Lorne and her started talking about coming here and being secretive about Sheldon being their friend..."

"Is that it?"

"More or less. They seemed alright... Are they really as dangerous as you say?"

"For sure. But it's okay. We're on the case. That's all. Thanks kid."

Silence. Agent 8 adjusted his earpiece, continuing to wait for Marina's signal.

"What the hell, Pearl?!" A new female voice came in over Pearl's transmission. "We vetted her! We've watched her for weeks! She's not evil or even dangerous! She just wants her old things so she can live a comfortable life like the rest of us!"

"Do you know that?"

"Yes! Even when she first came here---"

A series of loud beeps came in over the earpiece, interrupting the conversation. Marina's signal. Time to move.

"What the heck was that?"

"Just my phone, don't worry about it," Pearl's voice replied, before 8 lowered the volume and stepped into the alleyway, scanning for signs of the fugitive, from ground to sky.
