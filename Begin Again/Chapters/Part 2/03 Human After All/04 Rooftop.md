She'd climbed, of course. She didn't need ink for that.

*Unlike the rest of these fools*, she thought smugly, *I'm descended from the most well-known climbers in the animal kingdom*. She wasn't as great as climbing up things like poles when she'd put on weight as a human, but now that she was lightweight again, it had been nearly a breeze, once she got a feel for it again.

But the sound of Marina's friend's call made her pick up the pace. Now she stood on the rooftop of some building. More A/C refrigeration units up here. One corner housed the roof access, but there was a small gap between it and one of the raised edges that gave her an idea.

She rushed for it, and, transforming, wedged her squid self into the gap. She hoped that nobody would spot the light blue squid in this small space wallowing in fear and depression.

She didn't have to wait long to find out. A hook, like a grappling hook, whizzed by her and wedged itself into the wall next to her. She adjusted her position, getting ready to make another run for it if necessary.

The boy appeared first, climbing up upon the edge, eyes scanning the rooftops around her. Lily, underneath his feet, in the little crevice, stayed absolutely still.

He stepped off onto the ground, next to the stairs leading down into the building, and Marina appeared where the boy was. Neither of them noticed Lily slowly edge her way to the opposite end of the crevice, away from them.

They spread out, searching the roof. Stepping around the A/C units and piping, they covered as much of the area as they felt was necessary. No sign of her.

"Is human of jumping from this platform to another?" Agent 8 asked, walking over to one of the sides facing the next building.

"I don't think so. Not the way she was acting." Marina sighed. 

"Inkling girl and Sheldon crab is trust of her," the Octo boy said to her, gesturing at something in his ear. "This human did something to them?"

Marina was silent for a moment, looking over at him. "...No," she finally responded, with a sigh. "They looked completely normal. I don't know... I'm just scared we're going to have another repeat of NILS. I don't know what she's capable of. I still don't know what *humans* are capable of."

"What is Marina knowing of humans?"

"Well... she has access to human technology. I've seen her with a laptop and a phone. I think the car at the hotel might have been hers. She also hangs out with that one girl you heard from Pearl. I think she's been her friend since she arrived."

Lily took advantage of their inattention to inch her way over to the Octolings' climbing rope, trying to get up onto the ledge without changing and making noise.

Eight turned to look at Marina. "I am meaning... Coming of another Tartar is scaring me too. He played a fiddle with me, and she maybe will play us in..." He trailed off.

"...What?" Marina asked, concerned. She noticed Eight staring off in the direction of the rope they used to get up, past her shoulder. 

Marina turned around.

There was a light-blue squid frozen in place on the edge of the roof by the rope, its eyes frozen in their direction.

There she was.

They stared at each other for a few seconds.

And then Lily finally launched herself from the ledge, transforming, and as the Octolings ran over, they saw her rush back onto the sidewalk and disappear from view.

The human was gone.

Agent 8 and Marina both looked at each other, then leapt off from the roof and raced off in her direction.
