"And that's how it's done!" She got up from on top of Lily's unconscious form, dusting herself off. Then she noticed Marina and Eight on the ground a short ways away, and kicked Lily in the side again for good measure, before running over to check on her friends. "Shit, are you okay guys? What did she do?!"

"Ughh, I'm alright Pearl," Marina said, rolling onto her back and sitting up, rubbing her knees. "She just tripped me. Eight on the other hand..."

They both looked over at him, writhing in pain, clutching himself.

"She uh, she kicked him in a... sensitive area to get loose," Marina explained.

Pearl winced. "Yowch. Sorry Eight. Well, good job finding her, both of ya. I'm glad we didn't let the human get away."

"Yeah..." There was silence for a moment, except for the pained cries of Eight. "I wonder though..."

"Well, she's a squid now, right? Means just one easy way to be done with the humans for good." Pearl withdrew her Dualies from her pockets. "May I do the honors?"

"Pearl, no."

"What? Why?"

"I want to know." Marina finally got up and walked over to Lily's body. Pearl followed her, and tugged the backpack off of her body and started rifling through it. "She's basically confirmed for us that she *is* human. And that just raises more questions to me."

"Mmm. The timing of her arriving, all that stuff falling down, and then this thing with Eight and Tartar and Craig... It's all too suspect to ignore."

"It's all been rather strange, hasn't it?" Marina knelt down, slipping her hand into Lily's left shorts pocket and removing its contents. Both of her phones... "Well, before anything else, now's a great time to find out what she's doing here."

She pocketed the devices briefly, and maneuvered herself to grab Lily's shoulders. "Here, help me get her up against the wall. I don't suppose you brought anything we could bind her hands with, did you?"
