"let me in" was the entirety of the text Agent 4 received as she paced nervously about her apartment. As soon as she saw it was from Five, she'd rushed over to the apartment door and opened it, the electronic lock automatically disengaging.

Lily entered quickly, this air of intense worry and panic about her. "Shut the door," she said as she half-ran over to the bed, grabbing her backpack and starting to frantically pack her things into it.

"Lily, where are you going? I know they know now, but--"

"Lorne, I have to. I'm taking up Marie's offer."

"But just... just lay low here for a bit."

"They'll come after you. And Sheldon." Lily stopped packing for a moment, and turned around to her, clinging to her. "They think I am going to kill everyone or something. They gotta think you're my accomplices. I have to leave Inkopolis."

"...That's just ridiculous, Lily. How could they think that? You're only one person."

"I don't know. There was apparently another."

"Another what?"

"Human, apparently. I have to do some research when I get to the Hideout. Now where's my laptop..." She stopped holding onto Lorne and frantically swept the apartment for it, finding it on the couch.

"...Another human? Are you sure?"

"I don't know! Whatever they did or tried to do though, they seem to think I'm going to try to do. I heard them talking about it."

Lily shoved the laptop into the bag, checked her pockets for her phones, and picked up the backpack, swinging it onto her back.

"Lily. Remember what I said. Don't do anything rash."

"I'm not." She started to move. Lorne grabbed her hand.

"If you have to go and stay with the Sisters, then sure. But stay. With. Them. I don't want to see you get killed over this."

"I'll... I'll be fine. I'll text you when I get there."

"Fine. Just... come back soon, okay? I'm gonna miss you."

Lily turned to look at her pleading eyes. Her own eyes were teary. Quietly, she said, "I'll miss you too. I hope this won't be long term."

Lorne nodded, and silently pulled her friend into an embrace. Lily clung tightly to her, burying her head against her shoulder.

"...So I follow the sewer system?"

"...yeah... Head towards the square and I think you'll eventually figure out where you need to go."

Lily nodded. A moment's silence. "Lorne... I'm scared," she choked out.

"...I know, Lily. I'm scared too. I don't know what's going to happen." She leaned her head against Lily's. "Just... try and be strong for me, okay? Come home soon."

"...Home..."

Lily gently pulled away from the hug, and her hands moved around to take Agent 4's hands in hers. "I'll... I'll text you when I get to the Hideout."

"...Okay." Lorne was tearing up now too. She squeezed Agent 5's hands tight, and then let go.

They both stared at each other for a few moments.

Then Agent 5 slowly turned away, and made for the door. She opened it and turned back to her friend.

"Stay safe, Four."

"...Look who's talking. Take care of yourself, Five."

Lily nodded, and stepped outside, closing the door behind her.
