Lily kept running until she was at least two blocks away from the alleyway. Getting closer to the main CBD, the foot traffic became thicker and it got harder for her to maneuver around the people. On the plus side though, to her, the Octolings would have also found it more difficult to push through the crowd to her, and she was eventually able to lose them in the crowd, for the moment.

Once she felt sure she wasn't being followed anymore, Lily slowed down and found a bench to sit and think.

She took deep breaths, wiping sweat from her brow. She looked about at the crowd passing by her. For some reason she expected them all to avoid her, but besides being given an odd look by the folks she'd passed by on her run, nobody seemed to care who she was.

For now, anyway.

*Okay. Let's recap, me. You've been found out. By the news crew of all people. They seem to think you're tied to some other human, whoever this 'Tartar' is or was.*

*And because of him they think you're also going to try to 'wipe out everyone', whatever that actually meant.* 

*And now they must believe that Sheldon and Lorne are part of some conspiracy to ... I guess allow me to complete that task? Surely 'everyone' would include them, they realise? What did this Tartar guy do?!*

*Damnit, this life was too good to be true.*

She spent a few moments just wallowing for a moment. She felt guilty, for some reason. She wondered where she could be safe. Then she realised... 

*Wait, shit. The news. They know what I look like, they think I'm dangerous, they have a motive. They... they could actually expose me to the world.* 

... *I can't be seen again.*

*Not if don't want to ruin my friends' lives here. Not if I don't want people to stay safe.*

*So where do I go?*

Lily looked at her phone. It was only 2:30pm. She also noticed several messages waiting for her from Lorne.

"Where are you going??" "Don't do anything rash". "Marie says the Hideout welcomes you, use the sewers". 

*Right... that's right, I literally just ran off on them. They must be worried sick about me. Fuck, what do I do?*

*Our apartment is quiet enough that I should be able to get in without getting spotted by those two... three.*

*Who even was that boy, anyway?*

Lily typed out a quick reply. "I'm ok. Meet you at your place. Need to pack." 

She loaded up her map on her phone to figure out the quickest way back to the apartment, and set off again, following its directions.
