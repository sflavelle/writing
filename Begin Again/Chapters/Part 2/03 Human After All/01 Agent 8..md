## Human After All

Agent 8.

From somewhere deep underground, with the help of Pearl, Marina, and Captain Cuttlefish, who happened to be the leader of the legendary Squidbeak Splatoon, he had been given an entirely new life, here in Inkopolis.

But something about what he was doing right now, sprinting down the street after a fleeing Inkling, beside Marina Ida, felt very familiar.

And yet... after what he'd endured to get here, after what Marina had hurriedly told him as she had pulled him along, he knew something had to be done.

With his reddish tentacles styled like a Mohawk, and wearing casual clothing, he didn't look entirely out of place among the people moving along the sidewalk, though they gave the two Octolings a wide berth as they chased Lily down.

They both wore an earpiece hooked up to Marina's radio. As they listened to Pearls' impromptu interrogation, they chased the 'Inkling' down several blocks, even as she rushed into traffic just to attempt to escape the two.

They both saw her turn down another alleyway. Marina looked over at Agent 8 and noticed he had been carrying his backpack. "Hey, you got any of your old gear in there?"

"Uhh, I am having old Octarian gear still," he replied. Inkling was not his native language, and though he was being taught by Marina in her off-time, he was still a ways to go. "I am not having the time for sorting yet."

"That's okay. Good actually. I have an idea. Stop for a moment."

They halted just shy of the alleyway, and Marina rummaged through the pack quickly. "Come on... yes! A Disruptor! Oh! Even better, two!" She pulled two small devices from the pack. They looked like something that would play ultrasonic frequencies to repel mosquitos, but Marina took one and handed the other to Agent 8. "When we catch her, make sure we stick one of these on her."

Agent 8 nodded. "Marina approach from opposite of the ends. And then... eliminate the threat?"

"No!" Marina said firmly. "As much as I want to, no. Not unless it goes real ugly. Just... apprehend her. Incapacitate her if you have to. Whatever you have to do to stop her being a problem." Marina started to walk past the alleyway deliberately, as if she had not seen Lily turn down that way. "I'll signal through the radio when it's time to move in."
