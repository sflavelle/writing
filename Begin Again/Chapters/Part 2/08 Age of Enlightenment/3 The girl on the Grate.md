As the clock neared 11PM on Friday, Marina checked the time on her phone yet again.

"Hmm, this is strange," she remarked. "I hope things are OK..."

Neither Lily, Lorne, or the Squid Sisters were anywhere to be found, and the Square was empty as she, Pearl and Eight hung around outside the studio. The stores had long since shut, as had the studio, and so the light primarily came from the billboards and displays around them.

"They're actually coming, right?" Pearl asked with a hint of concern. "They wouldn't just pull our leg like this?"

"After everything, I don't see why they would..."

"Whoa. Hey, Marina?" Eight nudged her, and gestured toward Sheldon's store.

Atop the grate just outside Ammo Knights that led to the sewer canals, was a woman, standing silently.

She was dressed in black, though her yukata was lightly patterned, and she held a traditional Brella over her head to block the sunlight. It was an oddly familiar sight...

"Huh... who's that? I get the feeling I've seen them before, in that exact spot..." Marina focused, trying to get a read on if it was someone they knew. Eight turned to hear their conversation, now noticing the lady in black and green as well.

As the three watched her, she raised the Brella just slightly, enough to where they could see her eyes. And as the Inkling's gaze drifted over to them, Pearl realised just who it was. "Wait, isn't that... Marie?"

"I...think you're right. Let's go meet her." Marina started toward the grate.

But, having drawn their attention, Marie turned squid and dropped through the grate, and vanished.

"Hey--- wait!" Pearl called out, as she and Marina rushed over to the grate, trying to peer inside.

"I thought we were meeting here..." Marina was confused. "Is she... leading us somewhere?"

"Do we... trust her?" Eight asked, cautious. His Inklish had improved more over the past few days.

"We have to," Pearl responded. "Up here, *she's* your boss, *and* the boss of Lily and the other girl."

"Oh... yes." Eight's face sank. He wasn't sure what to think about the human being on his side. In his eyes, he was firmly on the side of these two girls, and the Captain... and Agent 3, no matter how weird he seemed.

"Well, no use waiting around," Marina sighed, and turned octopus, dropping down through the grate after Marie.

"Hey--- Wait for me!" Pearl shouted after her, and also shifted, leaving Eight to chase after the two, following them where-ever Marie was leading them...
