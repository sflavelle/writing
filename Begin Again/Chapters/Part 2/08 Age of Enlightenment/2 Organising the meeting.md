Pearl noticed from the studio right away as both Lily and Lorne appeared from the sewer grate opposite them. 

"Yo, there they are," she said loudly to Marina, focused on them. "Are you sure I gotta give 'em back?"

"They *are* hers, after all..." Marina sighed. "I get it. They're still... strange and new. But I'm pretty much convinced now. They're alright."

"Man, you *really* came around on her huh, Marina?" 

"I mean, when I talked to her this morning, she was polite, I didn't really get the sense she was deliberately hiding something... I mean, yeah, this Agent stuff is pretty crazy, but I get the impression that if we hadn't... started down this path with her, things would still be more-or-less normal, y'know?"

"I dunno... something about knowing she's not *really* one of us just..." Pearl creased her brow. "I don't know what it is I'm feeling about her, but..."

"Then I ask that you trust *me*." Marina rested a hand on Pearl's shoulder, leaning toward her. "I understand, but when we talk to her, *please* give her a try. For me?"

Pearl looked into her bandmate's eyes, and sighed. She knew Marina was a good judge of character. She guessed that she just felt the way she did because of Tartar and his origins... "Alright, 'Rina. For you, I'll give her a shot."

"Thanks, Pearlie. Because---"

There was a gentle thump, then a second, on the glass panel that separated them from the Square. Pearl turned to look, and saw that both Lily and her friend were leaning against it.

Lily had a letter or *something* up to the glass, her right hand holding it at about hip-height, trying to look casual. Neither girl was looking. Instead they were in conversation with each other. 

"...Because she's here," Marina finished. "Hey, that paper they've got. Is that for us?"

"Let's take a look, I guess." Pearl got out of her chair and walked over to the girls, kneeling down to read the message, and ignoring Marina's snorts - the message was at about butt-height to the girls, and it was hastily scribbled so Pearl had to lean close to make it out. "OK, yeah, this is for us. I'm gonna take a pic so I can get back over there."

"I'm gonna take a pic too," Marina chuckled, and Pearl heard the click of her phone camera.

"Aw, come on!" Pearl blushed angrily, pulling her phone out. "It's not my fault they--- ugh, whatever..." With another 'click', a picture of the message was captured and Pearl quickly stood up to rejoin Marina at the table. Pulling up the image, she read aloud: "Pearl, Marina, and '8'. Meet us outside Sheldon's, Friday, 11PM."

"Oh! Wow, guess this is happening, huh?" Marina leaned back and thought. *Two days from now... I wonder why so late?* "Alright, before they disappear, you better bring them to the side door. I'll be right over in a sec."

"Uh--- Right, right." Pearl put her phone away and walked back over to the two girls, who had put the letter away and were about to leave. She tapped on the glass, and both girls turned to see her. Lily visibly gulped nervously at the sight of her. *Well, I suppose she's right to be nervous about me,* Pearl thought to herself, feeling a little guilty. *Considering I nearly killed her...*

She pointed the two toward the side door, and made her way out of the studio herself to meet them there, stopping briefly to grab both of Lily's phones from the bag she left in the break room.

She was quickly at the door, and she took a few deep breaths as she laid her hand on the door handle. *C'mon Pearl... you can do this. For Marina...*

The turned the handle and pulled the door open, and as Lily and Lorne saw her she'd put on her 'persona'. "Ayo, girls!" She said with her usual enthusiasm, leaning her shoulder up against the door frame. "Got your message loud and clear."

"Uhh, hey Pearl." Lily looked quite uncomfortable doing this. Anxious, perhaps? "Listen I uhm... before anything else I just wanted to... apologise---"

Wait, huh? "Wait, why are---" Pearl started, confused.

"Why are you apologising?" Lorne said, confused and annoyed. Gesturing at Pearl, she said, "*She* should be the one to apologise!"

"Yeah, I uh..." Pearl took a deep breath. "Lily, I'm... really super sorry about what I did to you the other day. We... we didn't know what we know now. And now that... we *know* you weren't involved with... 'you know who', well... yeah, it doesn't really, um, justify...yeah."

"It's, um..." Lily tried to find the right words, that weren't 'it's okay'. "I guess I... I kinda deserved it... I never meant to intrude on Inkopolis, and I don't have a way back..."

"Mmm..." Pearl was silent for a few moments, unsure of how to follow that up.

Marina walked up behind her. "I guess we'll have plenty of time to discuss things like that on Friday, huh...?"

"Well... actually, that's less to do with Lily and more to do with... our bosses wanting to know what's been going on on your side. We have the brief from Marina, but, y'know..."

"Right, right... That's fair." Marina put on a smile. "Your 'bosses' being Callie and---"

"Yes, yes, alright!" Lily sighed exasperatedly. "Y'all know more than I expected you to about that... side of things."

"Well, again, we do keep in contact with Craig and Three..."

"I guess they trust *you two* a bunch then..?" Lorne sighed. "You two are... Man, this basically means we're two separate factions of the same team, then. It'd be nice to get everyone together for once."

"Mmm." Marina nodded. "Well, this meeting will be as close as we can get for a while."

"Yeah..." Pearl sighed, then, remembering, dug into her pockets, pulling out Lily's phones. "Well, we promised ya, kid. Here ya go." She held them out to her.

"I promise I haven't looked through them... since the sewers, anyway," Marina admitted guiltily. "I never touched your squid phone."

"...Well, I appreciate your honesty." Lily held the phones carefully, relieved to finally have them in her hands again. "Well... it's nice to have them back, at least. ...Oh, man, *finally*, I have all my music back! Yes!"

"Music?" That caught Marina's attention. "What kinda music you got on there?"

Lily held up her iPhone in response, with a grin. "It's on *this* thing, if that answers your question."

Pearl and Marina just stared at her and the phone for a moment, processing what she meant.

Then Marina gasped loudly. "Wait, wait - you have old music on that thing?! That's so cool!" The Octoling idol let out a squee of excitement. "Any way you could share some of it with us?"

"Well, I haven't really figured out how to get any of it off onto any other device, into a format that you guys could use... I guess I'll keep you up to date."

"Hmmm..." Marina thought for a moment, then reached out a hand. "Could I have your phone for a second? Your squid phone."

Lily cautiously handed it over. "Why...? What are you thinking?"

"I'm gonna give you my details." She tapped away at the device. "I'd love to help you get that stuff onto something more current. I'm not sure I'm the right person for that, but, I know one or two people who might be able to convert obscure formats like yours." She handed the phone back to Lily, who saw that the display now showed a contact page for 'Marina Ida'.

"Oh that's funny. The most popular digital music format in human history... obscure." She shrugged, and pocketed both phones. "Anyway, yeah, I guess I'll be in touch if you wanna help with that, and I'll... figure out how to get anything off my phone at all. Thanks."

"No worries." Marina smiled.

"So... Friday night, then?" Pearl asked, slightly impatient, ready to end this conversation.

"Yeah, I know it's a bit of an odd time," Lorne acknowledged. "I guess their reasoning is, hardly anyone will be around, and you two definitely won't be working by then."

"You got that right. Alright. We'll be there." Pearl nodded, and threw up a thumbs-up.

"Thanks for stopping by, girls!" Marina said cheerfully. "We'll be in touch!"

"Sure thing." Lily casually saluted as she started to make their way toward the Deca Tower entrance. "See you then, I guess."

"Seeya," Lorne said with a nod as both girls turned their backs to the idols.

Pearl and Marina watched them go, then closed the door and made their way back into the studio.
