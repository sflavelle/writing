Lily and Lorne sat quietly as the train carried their tired bodies toward West Inkopolis. It was somewhere past midnight and all they wanted more than anything else was to get home, crawl into bed and sleep.

At this time of night, the train was mostly empty. Most of the nocturnal, social creatures that *were* on the train were in the front carriages. The two inklings had chosen, again, to hang out in the back carriage, where their only passenger was another inkling, sleeping, with long hair and a thin blanket with an odd symbol draped over himself.

"Lily...?" Lorne asked her partner, who'd briefly zoned out. Lily shook her head to wake herself up a bit as she looked over. "If...if Tartar did have a way for you to go home... back to your time... would you take it?"

The 'sleeping' inkling's eye opened slightly, watching them discreetly.

Lily sighed. "It's... complicated. I... would love to see my friends again. To see my family again. To let them know I'm OK. To tell them of the wonderful world I've found here. And I... I'd kind of love to be able to show you the world that I lived in.

"But...if it was a one way thing, if I couldn't come back, or if I had to be an inkling forever, trapped in that old world... I just couldn't. Not anymore." Lily laid her head on Lorne's shoulder, yawning softly. "I do miss them. A lot. But I think I've been more successful under my own power in this world than I ever was in my own. And I have you, of course." She gently planted a kiss on her cheek. "And the others..."

"Okay..." Lorne rested her arm over the girl's shoulder. "I just... Is it bad of me to think that when you were talking about asking if there was 'a way back', that you still wanted to leave?"

"...No, I don't think you're wrong to think that..." She sat quietly, her drowsy brain trying to come up with the right words to explain what she was feeling, but couldn't think of any. Instead she simply said "I'm committed. To this team. To you. I just... want to know if that option was always there."

Lorne was silent.

"I couldn't leave anymore, Lorne," Lily repeat, sensing her partner might have been concerned with the answer. "I don't *want* to leave. I just... don't blame you for thinking that I might have." She checked her phone for the time. "God, can this train just get us home already? I'm too tired for this."

As the girls finally arrived at the apartment, they dragged their feet in silently, throwing off their shoes. Lily detoured into the kitchenette to pour two cold drinks.

"Can you close the door, Lily?" Lorne said sleepily, already crawling into the bed.

"Yeah, okay," replied Lily softly. She left the drinks on the counter temporarily, and walked back over to the apartment door.

As she moved to close it, a leg appeared and blocked the door from closing. Lily grumbled as its owner moved into view, an equally-tired inkling with lime-green hair and something around their head. "Excuse me," Lily said grumpily. "1AM is not the time for visitors. If you really need to talk to us, there's..." 

Lily had begun to notice something about this person. It was the sleeping inkling from the train. His blanket was tied around his neck and hung down his back like a cape.

"*Excuse me*," Lily said, a little angry now. Who *was* this stalker? "What are you doing following us? If you try anything, we're the *wrooong* people to fuck wi---"

"I'm not going to try anything," said the boy, "but I need to talk to you. ...And I also need a place to stay for the night. I don't know this part of town."

"No chance. Goodnight." Lily waved him off, but he didn't move.

"Agent 5."

Lily stopped, stunned for a few seconds. Pretending like she didn't understand, she replied, "Excuse me, what?"

"Agent 5. Real name Lily." He reached his hand in and opened the door further. "And your friend, Agent 4, real name Lorne. I *need* to talk to you both."

Lorne stared at him from the bed, before grumpily throwing the blankets aside and getting back up. She walked over to the doorway, and yanked the boy inside, closing the door with a thump. Lily flicked the kitchenette lights on. "OK, who the *fuck* are you," Lorne asked the boy, "and why are you at our door in the middle of the night?"

The boy straightened up, freeing himself from Lorne's grip. He undid the tie of the blanket around his neck again, and began to remove his bulky jumper. "I'm sorry to pull this on you so late. We only just got back a few hours ago, and only just found where you all were, but I had orders to find you..."

The jumper came free.

Underneath, the boy was wearing a long-sleeved black shirt, a hi-vis construction vest on top. As he pulled a familiar headset from the jumper's singular pocket, both Lily and Lorne's mouths dropped.

The boy said, "My name's Remo. I'm Agent 3. Captain Cuttlefish has asked me to come find you."
