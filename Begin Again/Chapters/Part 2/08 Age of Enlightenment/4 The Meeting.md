A minute or so later, following another strange, hidden grate inside the sewers, the three leapt from the last grate.

Marina's shoes hit the ground first, and she looked around herself. Pearl and Eight were just behind her. She gasped and froze as she realised just where they were.

She had been led back to Octo Canyon.

"No..." Marina took a slow step back. "This has to be a mistake."

"What do you mean?" Pearl asked, looking around. "Yeah this place looks crazy, but like... there's her Brella right there." She gestured at a little cabin just ahead of them, on which the Brella was indeed leaning against.

"Pearl, I mean..." Marina gulped, nervous. "Pearl, this place... this is the Octo Canyon. This is where half of the Octolings live. This is where *Octavio* lives. This is where *I* used to live."

"...Oh." Pearl bit her lip. "Well... they wouldn't have brought us to this part of it if it wasn't safe, yeah?"

Marina sighed. "I guess..."

"I think I've... never been here," Eight said quietly, nervously holding the Octo Shot by his side. "I grew in the Valley."

"Well, this area's all new to me," Pearl said, walking next to her band partner, looking around in semi-awe. "But check out all this cool floating stuff. Isn't your workshop around here somewhere?"

"Yeah... Shifty Station's around," Marina said. "Why do you ask?"

"I'm just... I can start to see where you get the tech to build that kinda stuff."

Marina sighed. "The Canyon's not that obvious of an inspiration, is it?"

"Only now that I know," Pearl nodded. Then she nudged Marina's side. "It's pretty rad, though. Like I tell you every time, that you build and work with all the things you do is pretty amazing."

"Heh... thanks." Marina smiled.

Marie and Callie were waiting for them on the other side of the Hideout, by the Octo Oven's kettle, dressed in Agent gear. Lily and Lorne were next to them, in casual clothing.

"Welcome, everyone," Callie, Agent 1, said. "Thank you for your co-operation. I don't believe we need to introduce ourselves..."

"Wait wait wait," Pearl butted in, recognising the uniform immediately. "*You two* are part of the Squidbeaks? THAT'S what you had meant, Marina?!" She shot a glance at the Octo, then turned back to the Sisters. "I mean, I know Cuttlefish is your grandpa and all, but--"

"Is that a problem?" Marie, Agent 2, cut her off. "We're involved in a bit more than just our music careers around here. Seems the same could be said for the two of you."

Marina sighed. "Yeah... I guess you could say that. It all kinda happened by mistake."

Callie prodded them. "Take a seat and take it from the top, girls. Tell us everything you can. What *happened* out there?"

With Pearl's and Eight's help, Marina told the Agents all about Off the Hook's trip to Mount Nantai, the encounter with the Captain and Eight, Commander Tartar and the Thangs, the Kamabo Corporation, NILS, Agent 3, and the battle at the statue. Callie, Marie, and Agents 4 and 5 listened quietly as they told their story.

"After that all happened," Pearl continued, bringing the story around to the present, "once we saw the weird newbie girl again," she gestured at Lily, "we realised that with her sudden appearance, plus the phone, stuff falling from the sky, the car... things just seemed to add up, but we didn't know for sure until Sheldon confirmed it for us."

"So, well... You know what happened after that," Marina added with a sigh. "We stopped Lily in the sewers to ask her some things, Pearl nearly... yeah, then after Marie rescued her was when we started to think about it more critically." 

"...I see." Marie turned briefly to Agent 5. "And you definitely didn't know anything about Tartar before?"

"Not until after it went down at the hotel, and only then it was his name and NILS. I haven't been carrying any secret evil plans or anything. Unless he really did have something to do with me getting brought here, I'd have no way of knowing if it's true or not."

"Well that's settled then." Marie turned back to Off The Hook and their Octo friend. "Agent 4 had told us you had moved Tartar somewhere outside Inkopolis. Do you remember where he is?"

"Yeah," Pearl nodded. "We took him deep into Triggerfish Forest, waaay out of the way. He can't hurt anyone there. Can't even move."

"Could you take us there?" Five asked, seemingly unplanned as Callie, Marie, *and* Agent 4 looked at her with concern. "With everything that's happened, I have some questions I'd like to ask him..."

"Uhh..." Marina raised an eyebrow, but seemed to understand. "I mean, we *could*, but it'll take some planning. It'd have to be a day that we could dedicate entirely to this trip..."

"The edge of Triggerfish Forest is about an hour out of the suburbs," Callie explained to Agent 5. "But it's massive. Even if we started from Camp Triggerfish, depending how deep in we have to go, it could be several hours to get there, *and* back."

"I understand. It's just..." Lily sighed. "From all accounts, he seems to be the only connection to the past. I loathe him for the impression he's made of humans on you guys, and the things he's done of course, but... I feel like he's the only lead I have on getting some answers about what happened... Why am I here, how did humans die out, is there a way back, that sort of thing..."

"...Mmm." Agent 4 nodded. "Well, if you're set on doing that, Lily, I'll make that journey with you."

"We'll... keep in touch about that," Marina nodded, but frowned. "If that is what you feel you need to do, we'll... We'll figure out some way to make that work. I would certainly be interested in those answers..."

"That's all I ask." Agent 5 fell silent again.

"Well, let's let things calm down a bit before we settle on anything," Marie said, mainly directed at Agent 5. "Lily, I'd like you to finish your training first before you make any sort of trip to meet Commander Tartar. I trust these two that he can't hurt you, but it can only help to be ready when confronting a creature like that."

"...Alright." Lily quietly nodded. "I'll do my best."

"Don't worry," Callie said with a smile. "You have our full support." She turned to the Octoling boy who had been so far sitting quietly by Pearl and Marina. "There's something we should address. If I understand this right, our leader Captain Cuttlefish named you Agent 8. Is that right?"

The boy nodded quietly. He was slightly unprepared for the attention being focused on him. "'Number 10,008' was being... much of a mouthful," he said quietly, with a gentle snort of almost-laughter.

"I... see. Well, from what we've heard, you've certainly earned your place here." Callie smiled at him, trying to come off as reassuring. "Do you have a name?"

This seemed to stun 'Eight'. He mumbled quietly and looked down at the ground.

"It's okay, they'll understand," Marina told him, resting her hand comfortingly on his shoulder. "May I tell them for you?"

The boy nodded silently, eyes closed.

"He's... lost some of his memory, from before the Metro," Marina explained to them. "From what I've been able to gather from talking to him and the Captain, the incident that caused him to end up in the Metro caused him to lose many details from his memory. Somehow... Cuttlefish told us that as he completed each station, he seemed to get memories about certain places and things back. But so far he has not been able to remember his real name. There still seems to be some gaps in the memory of his past." She sighed, and leaned across to give Eight a hug. "'Eight' has kinda stuck for us, so... that's what we've called him."

"Are you okay with us referring to you as 'Eight' in public then?" asked Marie, her voice softer than it was when talking to Lily.

"I..." The boy looked up at her, and slowly nodded. "I am okay with this."

"Very well." Marie nodded, and stood. "Before we move too far ahead, I feel that I should introduce you to the rest of the New Squidbeak Splatoon, Eight. My name is Marie - I'm Agent 2 on the team. I'm also one half of the pop duo 'The Squid Sisters'."

Callie volunteered next. "Welcome to the Squidbeaks, Agent 8. I'm Agent 1, my name's Callie. And I'm the other half of the Squid Sisters." She smiled. "From the sounds of things, you've already heard our rendition of the Calamari Inkantation."

*The melody etched on the soul...* Eight nodded.

Callie's smile widened. "Me and Marie's job, outside of our personal careers, is to protect Inkopolis from possible threats, and retaliate against attacks to our city. This is the job of all our Agents, first and foremost."

"We also occasionally run recruiting while the Captain's away. When the situation calls for it," Agent 2 added with a slight chuckle.

"You've already met Agent 3 of course. He's our oldest agent, outside of the two of us. In a way, I suppose that it's because of his determination to retake the stolen Great Zapfish two years ago that you're here with us today. I'm not sure that he knows that yet, though."

"Four, if you will?" Marie prompted, glancing at Lorne.

Lorne sighed. "Hi there, Agent 8. Yes, I'm Agent 4. Real name Lorne. I used to be a profreshional player in the Splat Zone leagues. I got enlisted about a month ago to beat back DJ Octavio for the Great Zapfish again, and rescue someone that had been captured by him." She eyed Callie, saying nothing, then turned her attention back to Eight. "I may seem a little uncomfortable with the situation, Eight, but that is not because of you - though I can't say I was thrilled with yours and Pearl's treatment of Lily... But it wasn't that long ago that we thought Octarians were the enemy. Sorry, Marina," she said as an aside to the darker-skinned idol.

"Wh-what? I'm not an..." Marina's eyes went wide and she immediately got all flustered, but went quiet as all eyes were on her, finally letting out a sigh and looking away. "Fine... I guess this isn't the time to try to pretend I'm not..."

"We've known since you first arrived," Marie said gently to her. "Me and Callie did, anyway. I believe Lorne is referring specifically to the Octarians under Octavio's control."

"And even then," Lorne added, "I think the three of us have pretty much agreed that it's only the big guy on top that's the problem."

"...Mmm." Marina looked back at them. "Okay. I could agree with that."

"I'm glad. I hope I didn't offend," Lorne sighed. "Though we should probably let Lily introduce herself now..."

Lily sighed, and glanced at Eight. He seemed like he didn't know what to think of her being here, as his attention finally turned to her. "I guess so... Hello Agent Eight. I'm sorry that our first meeting was under such drastic circumstances. I'm Agent 5, Lily. I'm... I'm the human. Ex-human. Whatever you want to call it." She paused for a moment to work out what she wanted to say next, knowing Eight was already judging, *had* already judged her. "I'm... an agent because the things that came through to this world with me are scattered throughout Inkopolis and beyond, including here in the Canyon, and while I don't know *what* everything is, I want to make sure that anything that I'm responsible for that could be used as a weapon does not get into the hands of someone *like* Octavio.

"In regards to Tartar, well, I think my only connection to him is that while I...used to be human - and make no mistake, the only part of me that's human anymore is my brain, my mind, my memories, whatever - he was created by humans, and survived all of this time that they've been extinct. He would, *should* know what happened in the time between when I was pulled from 2018 and dropped here. Course... After what what you, Marina and Pearl have told us about what happened out there... I kinda wanna just give him what for, on behalf of the rest of humankind." She sighed.

"You know, Lily," Lorne started. "I'm starting to notice you talk more when you're nervous."

"...Probably, yeah." Lily nodded, looking down. Then, glancing back at Eight, she extended a hand. "I just hope that, if me and Eight are going to be on the same team, that we can improve relations." She thought for a moment if she wanted to add anything else, but shook her head. "That's it from me."

"Thank you, Agent 5." Callie smiled. "How are you feeling, Eight?"

Eight looked around, turning to look at their faces. They all seemed to be welcoming him - even the human and Agent 2, Marie, the one who, only a week ago had him at the end of a Brella. He looked down at Lily's extended hand, and sighed. "I do not deserve this," he said slowly, before finally extending his own hand and clasping it in Lily's for a handshake. "Thank you to all. We have unfinished business," he added to Lily, "but I am thinking it can be settled in the turf wars."

"Sounds good," Lily nodded. "Probably the better way to work out our... brief history."

"Shouldn't Eight introduce himself properly?" Lorne asked One and Two.

"I'm not gonna make him do that this time around," Callie decided on the fly, eyeing the Octoling boy. "I am curious to learn more about him, but considering everything else that's been going on, I'm happy to just let him do that when he's ready."

"Probably in smaller groups as well," Marie added, "instead of all together like this. This meeting was more to get him to know us, and to finally know what this Tartar situation was."

"Well," Marina sighed, "We're glad we could finally talk to you guys about this. And... Lily," she turned to her. "I know we kinda said it the other day, but, just to get it on the record... We... were wrong. When we first found out you were human, we... well, you know. We thought you were part of Tartar's team."

Pearl continued. "We thought Tartar had summoned you to finish his job... I dunno, like maybe he had a backup weapon, and you were waiting for the right time and..."

"It's dumb in retrospect, we know... but it wasn't too long after we foiled him, that we met you at the Albacore Hotel. We were still coming off of that... that thing that we were moments away from the complete destruction of our world..."

"And we thought Octavio was the worst we had to worry about." Marie sighed. "I appreciate that you've done that, girls. Thank you." She pulled out her phone to check the time. "Goodness, we've been at this for a while. Alright, well, I think we should call it there, and reconvene at another time to let things cool off. I want to thank everyone who came out tonight. I know it wasn't friendly to some schedules, so I appreciate the effort you've all made. Marina, Pearl, Agent 8. Are you three right to get home?"

"Yeah, we'll be fine," Pearl said nonchalantly, with a slight yawn. "We can take Eight back to his place, it's cool."

"Alright, well. Dismissed." Marie stood up. "Again, thank you for coming by. We'll be in touch."

Everybody got up, stretching, everyone starting to make their way up to the grate back to Inkopolis. The Agents waved as Pearl, Marina and Eight disappeared down the grate, making their way back to the Square. 

As Lily and Lorne waited by the grate, allowing the first group enough time to leave the Square so none of them stood out, Lorne took a deep breath. "Callie, Marie, there's... something we ought to tell you, for transparency's sake."

Marie raised an eyebrow, asking "What's up, Four?". Callie grinned, to Lorne's confusion.

"Well...Me and Lily have started dating," she said quickly, trusting the two girls would understand. "Only recently, but... yeah. Now don't worry, we've both agreed to make sure that we won't let it impact our work, but---"

"Aw, that's cute!" Callie squeed. "I'll be honest, I kinda figured it out already. Congrats to both of you!" She pounced forward and embraced both girls in a hug, Lorne reciprocating. Lily blushed deeply, but also joined back in the hugging.

"Same," Marie nodded. "I'm glad that both of you have found comfort in each other. I hope that doesn't mean you'll have less time for your work," she added with a smirk, before also joining in briefly.

Smiles were wide when the girls pulled apart. "We'll be fiiiine," Lorne finally responded, finding Lily's hand and squeezing it gently. "But thank you for understanding, girls."

"Of course!" Callie grinned. "You two better get moving - we'll need to change out of this gear before we head out ourselves."

"Yeah, wearing this Agent stuff was more for showing off, to be honest." Marie chuckled. "Kinda to increase the impact we had on those three. I'd say it worked."

"I think so too." Lorne smiled. "Alright, we'll get moving, then, Lily. See you girls later."

Together, Lily and Lorne plunged into the sewer grate heading back to the Square.
