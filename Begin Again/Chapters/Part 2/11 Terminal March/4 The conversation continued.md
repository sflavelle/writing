The conversation continued for a few minutes, veering from topic to topic and eventually was interrupted by another announcement as the train began to slow. "*This train will shortly arrive into Inkopolis Plaza. Inkopolis Plaza is our next stop.*"

"Oh!" Marina said, and jumped to her feet. "I'll be back, guys. This is Remo and the Captain's stop." She waved out of habit as she slid open the compartment door and stepped outside.

"Lemme know if they still have that Squid Beatz cabinet!" Pearl yelled after her. To the others, she said, "Hope they do... I still head over to the Plaza some days to grind out the top scores."

There was a lull in the room as Lily, Lorne and Eight tapped on their phones idly.

"So, yo, Lily," Pearl started up again, with a curious look. "Were you ever gonna tell us you used to be a boy?"

Lorne looked up and glared at Pearl, while Eight's head snapped to look at Lily in shock and horror.

"No," Lily responded with a grumble. "That was my past life. It'd only have come up if a story from my past demanded that context. How'd you find out?"

"Was in Cuttlefish's file," Pearl replied nonchalantly. "D'you miss it?"

"Not particularly," Lily said flatly. "Well, I sometimes miss one particular part..." She crossed her legs. "But my identity and life never really corresponded to what gender I was." She shrugged. "I guess in a sense though, being a girl now has made me happier with myself. For the record, I do see that look you're giving me," Lily said as she turned to Eight, who was expressing grave concern. "My previous appearance has nothing to do with my current personality. I was always the same person, Eight, just, I have a more appropriate look now."

"I... think I see," Eight said slowly, and Lily got the impression he was not quite grasping the idea. She noticed him glancing down at her hips. "So do you not have a...?"

"*No,*" she said firmly. "No, I don't. I'm pure girl now. I *used* to before I changed, yes. I don't anymore."

"...Okay," said Eight, and seemed to let it go.

"So, what, with you and Lorne palling around," Pearl started again, "does that make you gay, or straight or...?"

Lily snorted. "I think biology dictates that makes me gay," she said with a laugh. "But I never really cared for labels along those lines. I love who I love. And that just happens to be her," she finished, and smiled at Lorne. "And she knows, of course, and accepts that."

"Eh, alright." Pearl shrugged, and left it well alone.

Lily noticed the train was starting to move again, and though she smiled and simply went back to using her phone, she was feeling a little uncomfortable. *Well, the next couple hours are bound to be a barrel of fun,* she remarked in her thoughts.

"Uh, hey, sorry kid," Pearl said, leaning in, noticing Lily didn't seem quite OK. "I guess I shouldn't have asked like that. I was only, y'know, curious."

Lily thought on those words for a moment. "I'm... not sure there's any nice way to directly broach that subject, I guess. Just, to hit me with that right out of the gate though?"

"Right outta what?" Pearl was confused. "What kinda saying is that?"

"Heh, don't worry about it. I think you got what I meant."

"Hey, look who's here!" came the voice of Marina as the door into their compartment opened, revealing Captain Cuttlefish and Agent 3. The two stepped inside, followed by Marina, as everyone greeted them. Marina and Craig sat down on Pearl's side, leaving Remo to sit/lean against the cupboard next to them.

"Hey guys!" Lorne said, and she, Eight, and Pearl waved them in. Lily did a small salute. "Doing well this morning?"

"Not too bad, Agent 4, not too bad." Craig rested his cane in front of him. "Ready to get down to business, is what I am."
