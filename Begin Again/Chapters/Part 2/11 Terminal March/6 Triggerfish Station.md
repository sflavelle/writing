At around 12:30PM, the tannoy announced the train's imminent arrival at Triggerfish Station. The first half of their journey was at an end.

Everybody in the compartment packed up their things, aside from Remo, Craig and Eight, who had never taken out anything but their phones.

As they slowly made their way from the room out into the train corridor, waiting for the train to stop at the station platform, Lily glanced at Agent 8. She was pleased that she and him seemed to be getting along better - it turned out that he enjoyed looking at and dissecting all sorts of technology, and that gelled with her own love of tech. Finally, she had something in common with him. 

Lorne came up behind her. "How ya feeling, hun?" she asked her, gently squeezing her hand.

Lily turned to her and smiled. "Better. That was a fun train ride. Never thought I'd say that before. But *god,* I'm glad to finally get out of that packed room."

"Hah!" Lorne pat her on the back as the group lurched forward, the train coming to a halt, the doors opening.

And one by one, Pearl, Marina, Craig, Remo, Lorne, Lily and Eight stepped off the train onto the Triggerfish Station platform.
