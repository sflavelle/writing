The gang chatted and hung out as the train headed toward the edge of the city, even as Marina convinced Lily to put her music library on shuffle.

While the carriage bobbed their head to acapella video game music, to techno, to electronic, to synthwave, the buildings outside gradually grew less tall, less dense, and the landscape became more green, less flat. Lily didn't realise it initially as they finally left Inkopolis, until she looked outside and suddenly saw green, green fields, trees, and farmland stretched off toward the horizon.

Lily stared out of the window in awe. Lush countryside. It was *beautiful*. She had missed this. She had a dumb smile on her face as she watched the world pass by.

"Lovely out there, isn't it?" Craig said with a knowing nod, watching her face. 

Lily nodded slowly. "Makes me miss taking trips through areas like this, hours and hours of farms, and mountains, and flat land stretching toward the horizon..." She looked away, toward the Captain. "I love it in the city, I can tell it's where I need to be. But it's comforting to know the world can still be beautiful on its own terms." 

She gave a cheesy smile, then, thinking, got up and rummaged through her bag for her laptop, pulling it out and sitting back down. On her way back down, she noticed that Eight was also staring out the window, and his expression was one of awe. "What's up, mate? You look like you've never seen the countryside before."

"He hasn't," Marina pointed out, turning away from the window. She had also been watching the scenery pass by. "Neither did I, until recently. Since the Great Turf War, Octarians have all lived underground... or in places like the Octo Valley, the Octo Canyon. We would've killed for such serene scenery."

"Your ancestors did," Craig pointed out, and sighed. "I suppose ours as well. It really is a shame the rising waters led to such bloodshed... How lucky for your kind, that the underground turned out to be so habitable."

"Wait... rising waters?" Lily glanced over to Craig and Marina.

"The levels have stabilised for now," Marina said, but nodded. "And have been for around a hundred years. But, yes. Many of our species' original settlements have been lost just due to the lost land. I think most of the remaining human ruins are also submerged."

"Huh..." Lily bit her lip. She had a feeling that she knew who was still responsible for that. She glanced down at her laptop. It had finished booting, and now sat at a standard Windows desktop. She searched for her music DAW, and let it load up. *Since Off the Hook are here,* she thought, *let's see if they will be into this...*

"What system is this?" Eight asked, peeking over her shoulder as attention turned back toward the music playing off Lily's iPhone.

"Oh, uh, this is... I haven't updated to anything from this time," Lily told him quietly. "It's an old operating system. I've got some stuff on there that I'm not quite finished with." She looked at the screen, and grinned - her last project, the one this world's music had inspired her to create, had loaded.

She let the acoustic sound of 'You Oughta Know' fade, then stopped the phone from playing any more music, for the time being, starting playback of the project, the beginning of Madeon's 'Cut The Kid' playing out. "Oh hey, this song! Wow, this reminds me of one of your songs, actually," Lily said with a grin to Off the Hook.

"Does it?" Pearl said with a raised eyebrow, and listened closer. The first beats played, and as she listened to the melody of the sampled piano closely, she started to notice something. "Yo, Marina. Doesn't that piano kinda sound like it's doing the Color Pulse thing?"

"Hey, yeah, I think it is!" Marina grinned. "Nice find, Lil---"

Then Color Pulse itself kicked in over the top of Cut the Kid, a funky mashup of the two, and Lily couldn't help but grin.

"Whoa! What's... Oh! You cheeky thing!" Pearl grinned back, realising immediately what she was listening to, hearing Marina's and her own voice over the top of the track. "You did this? Nice! You gotta send that to us!"

"I never thought I'd hear our music and... human music blended together like this," Marina said in wonder. "Never in my life. So, that mean you're *also* a musician?"

"Eh... not really." Lily shook her head. "I just like to mess with songs that are already done and do something weird with 'em. Honestly my talents lie in... a couple different places, and while I like making these they aren't what people knew me for."

"What *do* people know you for?"

Lily opened her mouth to speak, then stopped.

And thought. 

And thought.

She couldn't think of a single thing. She hadn't been known for anything.

She finally just murmured "nothing" and let the track play out.

"Really? You gotta promote yourself, kid." Pearl sat back. "All this music you been playin' today, right? There'll be an audience for this. Not just some stuffy historians. But remixes, mashups, whatever, like these? Blending the past and the present together? *THAT*'s worth a show."

"I promise ya, Pearl," Lily replied, as the mashup finished, and her hands moved to resume the phone's music playlist. "I've been daydreaming playing my mashups and DJ sets live for ages."

"Well... maybe this is the time to make it work." Marina smiled. "Just something to consider when this is all over."

Lily nodded, and smiled. She let herself fall silent for a while, and listen to the other conversations going on around them, between Lorne, Craig, and Remo.

Today, all of them were friends.
