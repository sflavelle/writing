As they walked around the stage, getting an idea of the layout, Lorne listened to her friend rant about the strange nature of the supermarket they would be battling in. The stage itself was very separate from the rest of the supermarket - elevated, varied in height compared to the rest of it being flat, and for whatever reason, surrounded by what seemed like a six-meter-wide pit, at the bottom of which was a carpark.

Some motion on the other side of the pit caught Lily's eye, and the looked to see several jellyfish creatures queuing up at a counter recessed into the wall. She looked closely and... "Hey, there's prepared lobster in there," she realised aloud to Lorne. "Wait, is that one behind the counter a butcher?"

For whatever reason, she had forgotten to consider that not all marine creatures were herbivores. Lorne moved her along before she had time to think about this too much.

Their referee came in over the earpiece. "All of our participants have arrived and are ready, so be ready to start in three minutes. Please begin to make your way to your team's starting point."

They passed another member of the opposing team on their way back, a girl with their tentacles tied back, big studio headphones on and a jacket that Lily couldn't help but envy. The three of them shook hands. "Good luck out there," she said politely.

"You too!" Lorne smiled, and as they walked away, she smirked as an opportunity struck her. She gestured Lily toward a jellyfish child playing among the rubber balls in the toys aisle. As Lily stepped toward the barrier to look closer, she was unable to see Lorne briefly unclip and remove her Anchor, and unsheathe her Aerospray MG.
