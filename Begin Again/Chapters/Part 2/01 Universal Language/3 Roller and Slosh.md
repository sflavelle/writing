"Oh, here we go again," said one of their two teammates, a boy leaning on his Splat Roller, watching this unfold by the respawn point.

"Again?" The other boy, idly spinning his Sloshing Machine on an edge, waiting for the two girls to come back, had a look of concern.

"Yeah, I keep getting matched up with this girl," Roller said. "She likes to prank the fresh meat and claim their first splat. Watch."

As they observed, Lorne, her hair and ink orange again, stepped up behind the 'fresh meat', and without any more warning, let loose a burst of ink at point blank. Her target was downed right away.

Slosh looked on, frowning. "How does she get away with that?"

"Seems like she does it regularly enough that they have looked into it, but they haven't done anything about it." Roller shrugged. "I guess it's never really been done with malicious intent... Ah, here she comes."

The tiny floating squid spirit that was Lily whizzed past them, and Roller walked back over to the Respawn point as it plunged into the ink.
