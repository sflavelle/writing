The battle went about as well for Lily as she expected. She was taken out annoyingly often; meanwhile, she'd only managed a single splat of her own. So she had quickly refocused on filling out the quieter parts of the arena.

They'd eked out her first victory, barely. When they had been led off the field afterward, Lily and Lorne stood off to one side of a corridor while their teammates, whom she had nicknamed Roller and Slosh for their choice of weaponry, stood and chatted nearby. 

"...Certainly a better first experience compared to playing my first game of paintball," Lily was saying to Lorne, recounting that experience as well. She was not a great shot then, either - and she was unlucky enough to be hit in the head a few times with paintball pellets, despite rules and wearing masks, which she admitted may have influenced her opinion.

"You did pretty well for your first game," Roller called, walking over to join their conversation. "I mean, as always there's things to improve on, from what I saw, but..."

"There always is," Lily nodded. "All considered, I think I did fine." She noticed out of the corner of her eye that Lorne had picked up her phone and was in the middle of her own conversation. "It'd be nice to be a pro player out of the gate, but let's be realistic..."

"Just comes down to practice," Roller said. "You'll get it down in time. I'm surprised you never played before though. What's up with that?"

"Oh, well..." Lily bit her lip. "Turf War wasn't much of a thing when I lived out in the country, and even then I was more into music and video games and stuff," she replied after a bit of thought, lying by omission.

"Ahh, no scene out there? Fair enough. Inkopolis is full of it, so you better get used to it!"

"Yo Lily," called Lorne as she slipped the phone away. "We gotta head out if you wanna see them take the car off the Albacore roof."

"Albacore? The hotel?" Roller asked them. "They were turning the roof into a new arena, aren't they?"

"That's the one," Lorne nodded. "They finally sourced some equipment to safely bring that thing down. Apparently it's heavy, like several tons."

The inkling boy whistled. "I kinda wanna come and see it. Mind if I join you girls?"

Lily made a slight frown and looked over to Lorne. "Uhhh... Anybody meeting us there?"

"Just our boy S. The others are busy." Lorne cocked her head at her.

Lily thought for a moment. "Alright, well, if you want to come with, I would be okay with it. Lorne?"

"Yeah, okay," Lorne said, and put on a smile. "Shall we go check out, then?"
