"You're kidding me. This is an arena?"

Lily and Lorne stood together to one side of the building while more squids gathered, talking casually with each other and equipped for the battle they were about to have.

Their friendship was a strange one: Lorne used to partake in Ranked Battles more often, but now she had taken on the role of Agent 4 of the New Squidbeak Splatoon, an organisation dedicated to the protection of Inkopolis from enemies known and unknown.

And Lily was formerly human, transformed as a result of contact with squid ink. And because she was collecting human artefacts that had travelled through time with her, across Inkopolis and beyond, she was designated Agent 5.

After she had sat through a brief Turf War induction and received her ID card, Lily had been directed to a shuttle bus that drove her and Lorne to the arena they would be battling on. They and all the participants on board had been outfitted with a small earpiece that the game's referee would communicate to everyone with, and an Anchor, a device that bound her to her team's respawn point, which also changed the color of her tentacles and her ink temporarily.

But it was only after they'd been directed through a side entrance onto the field that she saw what the stage was.

"What, you've never been into MakoMart before?" called a nearby boy from the opposing team. His was a sort of greenish color; Lily and Lorne were both sporting purple today.

Lily gestured at her level 1 top and briefly adjusted the headband. "Different franchises back home," she said. But he'd already turned away to talk with someone else from his team, supposedly a friend. "So I see some attitudes haven't changed," she said under her breath.
