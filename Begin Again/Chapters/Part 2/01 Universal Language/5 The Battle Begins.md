A brief moment of silence, just the ambience of the supermarket around them.

The sound of the loud starter pistol going off in the enclosed environment nearly made her jump.

"Go, go, go!" Slosh called out as they all pushed off the spawn point and opened fire around them, covering the ground in their team's purple ink.

Firing along the ground as they went, Lily and Lorne took off toward the right lane, The latter dropping down off the ledge before Lily who slowed to ink more of the ground. When she came to the ledge, Lorne called up, her squid eyes peeking out at her. "Quick! Get down here and transform!"

Lily did as she was told, and Lorne, topped off on ink, re-transformed and beckoned her to follow along the aisle they found themselves in. She noted that she felt much smaller as she cautiously swam behind Lorne's steps, though she knew that was obvious.

Nobody from the other team had come down this way by the time they had reached the end of the aisle, now on the enemy side. "Okay, let's flank," Lorne called softly to her. "Weapons ready. If you see 'em, get in close and let it rip."

Lily jumped up from the ink, Splattershot Jr at the ready, firing into the corner around her. Then she joined Lorne as they both headed into the middle path, moving for the center platform.

There was one opponent unaware of their play, but another coming from the other corridor had spotted them and was firing away. Lily and Lorne jumped back in opposite directions, and the projectiles turned in Lily's direction. She got off a few shots before she dipped down into the ink, making to swim around and surprise her opponent, and as she did so, Lorne focused her fire, and together their adversary didn't stand a chance. They burst into purple ink, and a tiny squid spirit flew off out of the inksplosion, towards their spawn.

Lily came up from the ink, and looked over at the middle. Two more squids from the other team were engaged in a battle, presumedly with her teammates. She regrouped with Lorne and they both moved to engage.

At least, Lorne did. With Roller and Slosh on the other side of the green team, the two didn't stand a chance.

But the fourth green opponent, the girl she had passed by before the battle, leapt out from cover towards Lily, holding her Roller like a sword of some kind. She had a moment to wonder what to do, before the enemy Roller came down, flinging a line of ink down on the ground, Lily caught in its path...

Splat.

The second time was not as surprising and shocking as the first, Lily found. As she felt herself pulled in the direction of their respawn point, she had a brief thought: *Better get ready for more of that...*

She was reborn in the ink, and she leapt out and back into the fray, headed for the central platform of the Makomart arena.
