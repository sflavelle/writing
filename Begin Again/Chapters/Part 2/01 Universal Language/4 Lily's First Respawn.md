Lily felt renewed, reinvigorated in the ink. 

She knew exactly what had just happened. And she was both shocked and a little angry.

As she swam out of the respawn point's ink pool, she was helped up by one of her teammates. His Splat Roller was leaning against a wall nearby.

"You alright?" He asked.

She immediately pulled her Splattershot Jr out. "I need revenge. One sec."

"No need!" Lorne called, Anchor reattached and arms out, approaching her. "You can't affect me, we're the same color!"

"What was that about?!" Lily yelled. "We haven't even started yet!"

"She does that to all the newbies she teams with," said the boy with the Roller. 

"You gotta be ready for everything, Lily!" Lorne nudged her as the referee announced the one-minute mark, and the team of four made their way onto the Spawn point. "And I kind of have an obligation now, yeah." She rolled her eyes at Roller. "Look, just stick with me for this game and you'll be fine. We'll take the right path," she directed at the two boys, "and hopefully flank someone going for the center."

"I'll head down the center then," said the Slosher boy.

"Then I've got the left," said Roller. "Lily, right? If you ever get separated, don't be afraid to ink and fill out the areas nearby the spawn. Or follow me, and we'll wreck shop with them."

"Got it." Lily took deep breaths. She was gonna have to focus her emotions on the battle. Glancing over to her right, she saw she would be headed up an incline, after which a drop would seem to lead them into the side corridor. *Just follow Lorne, as much as you want to get back at her*, she said to herself, *and you'll be fine.*

"Ten seconds," came the referee's voice in their earpieces. "Time begins at the sound of the starter pistol, and ends at the whistle."

The four of them got into position and prepared to move off, weapons at the ready.
