The three Agents were silent all the way in to the Square, Lily's anxiety running rampant, Lorne hugging and comforting her while Remo shot off anxious texts to the Captain and Marina's chatroom.

Lily didn't expect anything good to happen as they approached the grate that would take them to the Hideout. She had no idea what kind of person Captain Cuttlefish would be, she could only make assumptions, but - c'mon, he was a Captain, for goodness sake! AND he'd seen first-hand what Tartar, and humans, could do, *and* he'd been hanging out in Pearl and Marina and Eight's chat while they were all on the hunt for her.

And he was the leader of the Squidbeak bunch. Callie, Marie, Remo, and Eight knew him well. And after his absence, down in the Metro, he was finally back to... what? To pass judgement on her? To *personally* put an end to her? What if it was just to see her, though? To see what kind of person she was? Nah, her mind 'assured' her. He'd probably already decided what kind of person she was.

And now it was time to face the music.

"C'mon, Lily," Remo said to her as they stood around the sewer grate. "You've got nothing to worry about." He did a tiny hop and transformed, slipping through the grate first.

Lorne looked over at Lily again. "Easy for him to say," she said. "But Lily, whatever happens... I'm in your corner. You know that. I know the girls are too. You have our support. Let's go see what he wants." She too, transformed and fell into the grate, leaving Lily alone for a few seconds.

She knew they would all be waiting for her. At this point, she realised it would be best to just get it over with. After a moment to work up the courage, she tipped forward and, transforming, fell into the sewer grate.
