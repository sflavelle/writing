## Heart Is King

The sun rose on another day in Inkopolis.

Lily was the first of the girls to wake in the apartment, as the sunlight reflected off the building across the road and into the room. She slowly shifted under the blankets and reached across her dresser to grab her phone, checking the time.

It was 10AM. Lily blinked in surprise. It had been a long time since she had properly slept in. She actually *felt* well rested for once, especially after how long she and Lorne had been up last night. Usually she always just felt tired no matter how she slept.

She carefully slid out of bed, trying not to wake her partner, and walked over to the kitchenette to pour a cold, water-like drink.

On the way past the lounge space, she glanced over the couch at Remo, expecting him to be asleep. Instead, he was silently tapping away on his phone, his blanket draped over him - wait, now that she saw it properly, it did seem more like a cape - and glanced up as Lily passed, acknowledging her with a nod.

Neither of the girls had been thrilled at his sudden arrival and demand to speak with them - but he had capitulated to their compromise to talk to him in the morning.

In the light of the morning, Lily first noticed the discolouration on his face - a splotch of greenish-blue around his right eye, and the mismatched colours of his eyes as a result. It was... unnerving to look at, and even more so now that Lily knew the whole story, and knew that it was the mark left by a genocidal AI.

Remo cleared his throat conspicuously - he knew she was examining his eye, and seemed to not be comfortable with it. Lily sighed in response, as she continued into the kitchenette. "Sleep well? Want me to pour some naturals for you too?"

"Yes, please," he said, quietly. "I slept alright. Beats subway benches."

"Mmm." She grabbed two plastic cups from the cupboards in the bench that separated her from the lounge space, and filled them with the watery oils from the taps. She walked back over to the couch, handed him one of the cups, and sat on the couch arm opposite his head, sipping at her own.

The silence lasted a few uncomfortable minutes, as Lily couldn't think of anything appropriate to say.

"...Look," Remo finally said with an exasperated sigh. "If you need to ask about the eye, just ask. Just get it out of the way."

Lily finally looked back at him, and Agent 3 could see she was saddened. "I... don't have anything to ask about it," she said quietly, eyes flickering to the bed as he saw Lorne begin to stir. "I just feel awful because I finally know who did that to you. I don't know what you must think of me, considering you probably know - you *must* know what I used to be - but I promise you that I have never worked with him, I have no intention of destroying anything, I..." She trailed off, not able to finish the thought, and sighed, looking down at the cold drink in her hand. Quietly she finished, "I'm sorry that my kind created the likes of him. I promise that I'm not the same..."

Remo watched her quietly for a moment, examining her in the soft morning light. Like his friends above-ground had said, she seemed like a regular inkling on the outside, if a bit odd. To think that she was a human in hiding... He remembered the conversation he'd overheard on the train. She was comfortable living here, even if she missed all her human friends... 

Someone's phone buzzed with a notification. Remo checked his phone.

"Lily," Lorne groaned groggily from the bed, "your phone's over here."

"Oh, thanks hun." Lily slid off the couch and walked back over to the bed, grabbing her phone off her dresser, leaning over to peck Lorne's cheek while she was there.

Lily stood back up and started checking the phone. It was a message from Marie. She read it silently at first, and Remo saw her face drop. She read the message aloud to him and Lorne: "'Lily, please bring Lorne and your guest to the usual place as soon as you're all awake'... signed M, C... and C."

Lorne turned over in the bed to face her, drowsy. "Two Cs?" She couldn't help yawning right after, and forced herself to sit up. "Who's the second?"

"The Captain, I imagine," Remo replied matter-of-factly. "He was taking after Agents 1 and 2 to talk to them while I tailed you two."

Lily stared at him, then walked over to the couch, annoyed. "Alright, what's this about, Three? I *hope* y'all know I'm on your side by now! What does he think I'm gonna do?! Turn around and shoot my bosses in the back? My girlfriend?! I've got *no way back* that I know of - I'm not just gonna blow away this new life I have!"

"Lily, please relax." He sat up on the couch, stretching as he grabbed his hoodie and his cape. "I know you have not met him, but please trust me on this. I'm sure he trusts One and Two's judgement."

"I'm just...I mean Pearl nearly killed me over---"

"She WHAT?!" Lorne shouted as she finally got up, staring at her and frustrated. "Why didn't you tell me this?! And you *still* felt the need to try to *apologise to her* on Wednesday?!"

"Yeah, hang on," Remo said with a look of concern. "I never heard this."

"Oh, yeah, you know how they had a 'chat' with me in the sewers? That was Pearl and your Agent 8 holding me at gunpoint with something called a Disruptor. I'm pretty sure it was just Pearl wanting me to admit to being this awful, evil creature y'all wanted me to be."

"For the love of the Great Zapfish, Lily... and you *STILL* apologised to her." Lorne was furious now.

"I'm sorry, hun, but like... I already told you how my mind works. I felt bad for even taking up their time."

"Damnit, Lily..." Lorne sighed, grabbed her backpack from underneath the bed, walked over and hugged Lily tightly. "We have some work to do when we get you back on the training, alright? I *need* you to break this."

"I'm... I'm sorr---"

"Stop that!" Lorne clung tighter, and Lily let out a sigh.
