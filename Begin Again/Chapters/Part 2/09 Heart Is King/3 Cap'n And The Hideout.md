Agent Three was the first to arrive in the Tentakeel Hideout.

And as expected, Agents 1 and 2, and Captain Cuttlefish were there to greet them.

The three were already in a passionate conversation, though it seemed like they had already moved on from the subject of Lily.

"You two knew what he was capable of! Why would you let her get captured like that?" Cuttlefish was demanding of Marie.

"Hey, hang on!" Marie said with a hint of frustration in her voice. "We were going through a rough patch already, you saw how that last Splatfest ended! And we were already starting to have solo careers taking off, it just..."

"Gramps, yeah we were having some trouble with each other, but the decision to go and vent to Octavio was my own! *I'm* the one that messed up! It's not like I thought he could do anything!" Callie grumbled.

"Either way, Gramps, it's not like we didn't fix it in the end."

Agent 4 was next to arrive, and as she heard the argument she also paused, just behind Remo. Seeing Captain Cuttlefish for the first time, Lorne thought he was much older than she had been led to believe, with all his wrinkles and that beard. And what was this old-person getup he was wearing? And the cane - if that was even a cane? After all, Marie's Brella was more than just a prop...

"Yeah? Then where is he, girls?"

"We moved him temporarily to where that overgrown bread box used to be," Marie said. "With Off the Hook visiting late last night, I didn't want to create a situation between Marina and Octavio, with everything else going on..."

"Hmmm... That's a good point." Craig scritched at his tentacle beard. "And the human knows about him?"

Callie sighed. "C'mon, Gramps. For the last time, her name's Lily, and yes, she's met him up here. She knows his history---"

"Agent 3!" Marie called suddenly, noticing him and Agent 4, glad to have an out. "It's been so long. It's so good to see you again."

Agent 3 walked up to the three of them, shaking hands with Callie, Marie, and the Captain. "It's good to be back home, Agent 2, Agent 1. Is this a bad time?"

"No, no, it's OK," Cuttlefish told him. "We're just working out a few details. Ah, Agent 4, I believe!" His attention turned to the younger Inkling, and came forward to shake her hand. "A pleasure to finally meet you. I've heard about your recent work - I'm very proud of you for being able to defeat DJ Octavio."

"Uhh - Thank you, sir." Lorne felt somewhat awkward about this whole situation, but shook the man's hand anyway. "It's an honor to finally meet you."

Cuttlefish smiled warmly at her, then looked around, realising someone was missing. "Is the h..." He sighed and stopped himself, noticing Marie's glare. "Is... Agent Five far behind you both?"

"She's..." Agent 4 turned around to the grate. "She was very nervous about coming in, but she must've been only a few seconds behind us." She walked over to the grate and knelt down over it, peering inside, trying to see how far away Lily might have been.

But to her surprise, the squid she was looking for was simply hiding in the inkrail, a blob of squid with her eyes sad, nervous. She had to have been there not long after she had arrived.

"C'mon Lily," Lorne said, trying to comfort her. "I know this is scary for you, but I don't think he'll hurt you. One and Two are up here too. Remember what I told ya before."

Lily simply stared up at her, but from her changing expressions it seemed she was at least thinking about it. Four heard Cuttlefish walking up behind her, watched him glance into the grate at Lily.

"Good morning, Agent 5," he said simply down at her. "Nervous to meet me, eh? I guess I don't exactly blame you, from the sounds of things we all have reasons to be nervous." He adjusted his glasses. "Come on up, Five, let's get a look at ya."

Lily stared up at them for a few moments, then blinked her eyes, and leapt up into the air and through the grate, shoes landing on the metal bars as she fluidly transformed back into her humanoid self. Her face still showed nerves, but from what Lorne and Remo could see she was at least less frightened than she was before. Quietly, looking at the ground she said, "H...hello Captain."

They guided her back to the Cabin and sat her down. Marie sat on one side of Lily while the Cap'n sat on the other side. As Marie calmed her and spoke to Remo, Agents 3 and 4 moving in a little closer, Craig examined Agent 5 carefully. As Remo had found, outwardly she didn't seem too different from many of today's Inklings he had seen - and like the profiles had said... "You and Agent 4 look almost alike," Craig mentioned to Lily, watching her expression carefully. "Is there a reason for that?"

Lily sighed, and nodded. "I... didn't just arrive fully transformed. I didn't... didn't just survive all these years. Like, it still doesn't feel that long ago to me that I was just living at home, with my family, and all the humans were alive and I had had a much more boring life. But, we found out that like... everything on this planet has evolved, their defense and attack mechanisms have evolved and grown stronger, but everything's still roughly at the same level, relatively, because everything was evolving to counteract each other. So my... my *old* body simply was not equipped to handle it."

"Is... that true?" Craig raised an eyebrow at her.

"I don't actually know," she conceded with a shrug. "That's only my guess. The explicit truth is, according to Mar... Agent 2, when I arrived in this world I was blacked out and fell into a pool of Agent 4's ink. It... corrupted my DNA, or something along those lines. And uh... how long did it take to find out I was changed?"

Marie responded, "If I remember right, it was about a day and a... half? The time from us getting you into the Cabin to the next night when I checked in with some gear."

"Gear...? For a human, Agent 2?"

"The Octolings had stopped attacking, and we were worried that they had managed to ping her or something, and wanted to kidnap her, too." Marie shrugged. "I wanted to be sure that if me and/or Four were occupied, and they *did* try to attack the Hideout, or her, that she could at least fend them off long enough for us to get there."

"And she ended up being right, they did try to capture me," Lily chuckled. "I knew nothing, but I managed to surprise them and hold 'em off long enough for Marie to come and save me."

"I see. And what have you been doing since?" Craig prodded gently, Remo listening intently.

"Well..." Lily thought back over the past month. "I *did* look after the Cabin when Agent 2 and Agent 4 took on Octavio directly, been settling in to Inkopolis... I guess the main thing is I've been venturing out and collecting these items that came through the... portal, I guess, with me." She dug into her pocket, pulling out the iPhone once again, and handing it to Craig to look at, and then opened up her backpack, sitting at her feet, and pulled out the Acer laptop sitting behind her Agent gear, sitting it in her lap, folded. "We have a rough idea of where things are, or rather, where things were when we started looking. Some of it, we assume has landed in Octarian hands by now. I *definitely* know a pair of headphones I used to have conked Octavio on the head. There's at least one more thing in the city, something outside of the city limits... There's something in Grizzco waters which will... be '*fun'* to try and get..."

"Grizzco?" Captain Cuttlefish glanced at Callie and Marie.

"That's that power-egg thing the younger kids are doing for work?" Marie explained.

"Y'know that weird company that's operating out at all those small outposts in the ocean where the Salmonids lay their eggs?" Callie furthered. "Otherwise prohibited territory? That's those guys."

"Hmm." Craig glanced down at the fancy human phone in his hand. It seemed similar in function to those other fancy cellphones the squids had nowadays, but it wasn't shaped in any particular way. It was just... a box. A rectangle. Her laptop looked more like something older squids would carry around. The main difference with this one was the brand logo was basically unreadable to him, and the few stickers adorning it were of things he had no idea of... besides the one Squid Sisters logo tucked into the corner. Craig chuckled, and handed the phone back over.

"If you don't mind me asking," Remo piped in, gesturing at the laptop, "What are all these stickers about?"

"Well, I suppose it doesn't hurt to explain them." Lily pointed at the one at the top left, the more recognisable of the lot due to its D-Pad-like logo. The right side of the D-Pad was used to form part of the words 'Games **D**one Quick'. "This one's for a video game running marathon. People would get together and try to beat video games as fast as possible, and any proceeds they made would go to charity." She began to smile as she did this, going through old memories as she talked through everything.

She moved to the next logos. One was a diamond-shape with two 'arrows' on the left and right sides, and the inside of the shapes depicted some sort of landscape. "This one is for one of the music artists I enjoyed listening to in my time. And this," her finger moved to the logo below it, a 3D cross-type symbol with oil running over it, "is not only one of my favorite electronic music duos, but the first show I got to see performed live."

The sticker under that was the text 'still a piece of GARBAGE' in an... interesting style, atop the pixellated icon of a trash can. "This one is for a guy who made these silly short videos that I used to love. The text says 'still a piece of garbage', and the icon... yeah. I've seen trash cans here in Inkopolis." She moved her finger to the last sticker, the Squid Sisters logo she had had applied recently. "No comment. Bought it for obvious reasons, but also I figured it would help me blend in when I used it."

"I'm... not sure what I expected human culture to be," Callie noted as Lily put the phone in her pocket and the laptop back in the bag. "It's cool you're repping your favorite music though! I'm totally not just saying that because we're also on there." She grinned at Lily, who giggled softly.

"Well, Agent 5, consider me pleasantly surprised," Craig said, tapping his cane idly against the ground. "I'm not entirely sure what I thought to find up here, but I admittedly believed it would not be much in the way of good things. For that, I apologise."

Lily looked at him in surprise. Around her, Lorne breathed a sigh of relief, and Callie and Marie smiled, the latter resting a hand on Lily's shoulder. "I... wow, sir. Thank you."

"I do have a question about your future plans, though." Craig watched her expression drop slightly. "Agents 1 and 2 tell me you want to visit the resting place of Tartar. That telephone. But they didn't go into your reasoning..."

"We had a bit of an argument before you three turned up today," Marie explained sadly. "We kept talking over each other. But Lily, if you could tell him what you told us last night..."

Lily nodded, and sighed. "As you know, Captain, it's strange that I'm here at all. The circumstances around my arrival are still... unknown as far as I know." She started to think back to when it had all begun, though the details on the other side were slightly fuzzier. "In this new reality, 12,000 years later, I should be the *only* human alive. If you can still call me human... But then we start hearing about Tartar, this thing that nearly destroyed your world, probably just because he wanted humans to evolve into existence again. But he was *made from humans*, back when I was alive. He's existed for all of this time. He must know what happened to humans, why we died out. 

"He... he might know what happened to *me*. Hell, he might be *responsible* for what happened to me. And if he brought me here... he may know if I was always just meant to be dropped here without a way home." Lily closed her eyes and took deep breaths. "I hate that he may be my only chance to find this stuff out, but while he can't do anything to us... my current idea is to... pretend to be on his side when I meet him. At least until I can't stomach him anymore. I can't pretend I'm not an inkling. But if I say something like, 'I'm a human who was turned against his will', he might be more willing to give answers."

"What will you do if he's no help to you?" Remo asked with a raised eyebrow.

"Then..." Lily shrugged. "I'm gonna give him what for either way. He shouldn't be the one representing humans in this world. It probably wouldn't do much, but maybe it'll make him think for a bit if not even humans like him."

"It probably won't," Remo sighed.

"Probably not," Lily conceded. "It'd make *me* feel better, though."

"Hmm." Captain Cuttlefish had stood and was pacing about nearby the group. "I suppose you're in a unique situation to speak to him. But what about after that? What do you plan to do next?"

"Well... train up more through battling and whatever the other Agents have planned for me... venture out and collect more artifacts... and I guess assist in other missions where needed."

Craig nodded, in thought. "Would you consent then, Agent Five, for me to test your current ability in arena combat?"

"Uh... why?" Lily glanced at him, confused.

"Simply to see where to focus your training." For the first time since they had met, Cuttlefish actually *smiled* at her. "And, selfishly, I would like to see my Agents in action."

"Oh? Are they training with me?" Lily asked, smiling.
