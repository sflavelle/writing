Some time and plenty of testing later, Lily and crew left Ammo Knights carrying a case containing her brand new Splat Dualies. She was excited to try them out after putting them through their paces in the range, though she needed more time to practice using the dodge mechanism.

The next stop for the girls was the shop next door, Headspace. This shop didn't seem to be just a pun for a name, Lily saw as the door jingled open - while there were indeed plenty of hats and other headgear on display on head models and on racks, there were also plenty of other items around that gave Lily the impression that this was a place to relax. Giant cushions by a seating area near the back of the shopfront. A few small plants grew in pots around the room. Cloth and ornamental pots hung from the ceiling And there was a distinct aroma throughout the room, thick and sweet - though Lily was unsure whether that was a result of the scented reed sticks or the shop's owner, a creature that looked more like a witch to her than anything that used to live in the sea, wearing clothing that seemed slightly too big for her.

"Ah, welcome, little inkfishies," the creature said as she turned to meet them, her voice soft and kind. "Aah - the Calamari cousins - welcome back to my abode. And to you, my dear," she said to Lorne. "I can feel it, your aura has grown from experience since we last met. And your friend here," she turned to Lily, examining her and noticing her slight confusion. "She is new here, is she not? And yet, she is different. She is a breath of fresh air in this city."

"I think that's probably the nicest thing anyone outside of my friends has said about me," Lily breathed, slightly stunned.

After they had introduced her to Flow the sea slug and Craymond, the crayfish with seemingly no inside voice, Callie and Marie waited outside (Lily noticed as they left they had been holding their breath the whole time), while Lorne and Lily browsed through the supply available, from wide-brimmed hats to beanies to caps, glasses, and headsets.

The longer they browsed, the more Lily began to feel lightheaded and slightly intoxicated from the aromas in the shop. She started to realise this as she was trying on one of the short beanies, and eyeing a pair of on-ear headphones with the Squidfin branding. The inkling turned to Flow, who had been sat on one of the plush cushions in the corner. "H-hey..." Lily called quietly, more timidly than usual, her cheeks flushed involuntarily, "What is... this scent? It's nice but it's... starting to get a bit, overbearing..."

"Is it...? Oh, my dear little inkfish..." Flow gave a small smile. "I'm so happy that you like it. That would be a mixture of the floral scented oils I'm diffusing and my own natural scents."

"I see..." Lily blinked her eyes. "Well um, I should... come back another time and discuss those oils. It's... a very relaxing scent."

"C-come on Lily," Lorne said, tugging on her shoulder. She was less affected by the aroma, being more used to this store. "I'm not having anything this... strong in our home. Have you picked what you're getting?"

They left the shop a few short minutes later, with a paper bag with the Short Beanie *and* the Squidfin Hook Cans she had been eyeing, and Lily gulped in the fresh air outside.

"You alright, Lil'?" Callie asked, concerned as they noticed her flushed face.

Lily took deep breaths, trying to clear her system. "I think I'm right. I just wasn't expecting it to be *that* strong a scent inside..."

Lorne was watching over her. "Her pheromones were definitely strong today, whether she means 'em to be or not. It's probably good we got her out of there before too long. Though besides that," she glanced at Lily, "if she keeps that under control, I feel like those two might get along quite well."

"Well, more friends for Lily is always a plus," Callie said with a smile. "Shall we go get some clothes?"
