When the girls left the shops of Inkopolis Square half an hour later to eat, the space underneath Lily's seat at their table was full of bags - Sheldon's Splat Dualies case, Flow's Short Beanie and Hook Cans, Jelfonzo's Pink Hoodie and Icewave Tee, and Bisk's Neon Sea Slug sneakers.

Jelfonzo had been... different, to Sheldon or Flow. His store was relatively minimal, but his quirky nature expressed itself in the way he talked - it seemed to Lily that he spoke with an Olde English-like vocabulary - indeed, his store was named "Ye Olde Cloth Shoppe" and he seemed to carry himself in a 'chivalrous' manner, *almost* like one of those 'milady' types (when he didn't seem to be trying to insult her choice in clothing through his overly flowery language, which she understood and ignored).

Bisk, who ran the Shella Fresh shoe store though, seemed actually cool, if a bit too sporty for her taste. He was actually quite respectful, and as Lily and her friends tried to decide on which shoes would work for her, based on style and the ability infused into them - something Lily hadn't wrapped her head around yet, the idea of clothing amplifying an aspect of her play - he offered a few of his own helpful suggestions.

And now, as Lily, Lorne, Callie and Marie ate Seanwiches from Crusty Sean's mobile stall, they chatted happily about Lily's purchases and the journey she would be making soon.

"So, wait, what did you *think* was outside of Inkopolis?" Callie prodded her between bites, after Lily had expressed some surprise that anything existed outside the city limits.

"I dunno! I kind of just assumed that *all* of marine-kind just sorta lived here or in Octopia!" Lily sighed and shrugged. "I kinda thought that, y'know, the rest of the planet was like, uninhabited or uninhabitable or something."

"I mean, I think it's been stated in geography classes that like, 95% of sapient life lives around this part of the globe," Marie told her gently. "You're somewhat right in that the rest of it is basically uninhabited, but not so much for any bad reason. It's more that Inkopolis is the social hub for our kind."

"Yeah, there are a few towns outside of Inkopolis, within some hours' travel," Callie added. "Calamari County, for example, where Marie and I came from." She grinned. "There's a separate town right on the edge of Inkopolis that I believe your train will pass through, and it's way different to the many suburbs in the city. More traditional."

"Hey, speaking of, isn't there supposedly an artefact out around there? Maybe it's worth making a stop on your way there, or on the way back, and taking a look around for it."

"Oh yeahhhh." Lily nodded, remembering. Though she knew most of the human items she was seeking were around Inkopolis and Octopia proper, there was one item she knew of that was outside of the city. And depending on how far away this town was from the edge of Inkopolis, it *might* perhaps be found there. If not... who knew what kind of environment she would have to traverse instead.

They continued to talk for a while, but they were soon interrupted by the voice of Sheldon, who was on his way over to them.

"Hello again!" he greeted them happily. "I'm glad I caught you before you left the Square - I've realised I've been needing to share this invention with all of you!"

"Invention...?" Marie asked. "If it's a weapon, it can probably wait til things are quieter."

"Not to worry, girls. This won't take long." Sheldon caught his breath. "Marie, Lily, Lorne. You may remember when all this began with Lily, Miss Marie had asked me to design a translator tool for the human language."

"Yes, I remember," Lorne nodded.

"Well, I think it's finally ready for testing!" Sheldon excitedly pulled out a case which he opened to reveal several singular earbuds, enough for everyone, minus one for Lily. "Well, it *maaay* have been ready for a week, but, y'know... Please, take one and pop it in your ear. I'm tentatively calling it the 'Babelfish'... a name I'm sure Lily will appreciate."

Lily shot him a thumbs up and a grin.

"So, I'll need a demonstration, Lily. Could you please play the talk show episode you sent to me?"

"Uhhh... Sure." Lily pulled out her iPhone, glad to have it again. She quickly found her podcast app, and pressed play on the one Giant Bombcast episode she had had cached from 2018. And since she could, she skipped ahead to where the \#FreeScott discussion had begun.

["*Alright, we* were *gonna roll right into the regular news...*"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYmOV6aVImo) the voice of Brad, the show's main host, begun, speaking through the phone's speaker. Of course, for now, Lily was the only one to understand him, and the other people - other humans, Lily corrected herself - that began to speak up after him.

"Whoa..." Callie gasped. She'd never heard a recording of a human voice before, none of them had. It was so much... different to their own. "This is wild... You used to sound like this, Lily?"

"You could...say that, I guess."

Sheldon let them all listen for a moment, letting them take in just how humans sounded unaltered. Lily noticed that he had a similar earbud in his ear, too. "Thank you, Lily. Keep that playing for now. Alright everyone, now I need you to feel around the underside of the earbud for a switch, and flick it on."

He switched his on, and everyone else did the same. For a few seconds, nothing seemed different.

But then, something seemed to click.

*"--Beast reached out to the host of HQ, which is the trivia app we talked about--- Scott, uh--"*

*"Rogo? Rogo."*

*"They reached out to him like 'hey, what's up?'---asked him some questions, and at some point they contacted HQ and asked* them *some questions, at which point..."*

The whole group of squids was quiet, eyeing each other as they listened to the banter. *Human* banter. Three, maybe four humans in the same room, talking about a news article about *another* couple of humans. Sheldon and Lily both smiled as the others realised that the alien words started to make sense.

"Holy shit, Sheldon..." Callie was the first to speak. "How-- But they don't sound any different than before--"

"Correct." Sheldon grinned. "I'm proud of this - it's not directly translating the voices. Instead, using the data from the samples Lily has sent me, myself and a small crew of researchers and developers have made a tool that sends signals to the brain, telling you how to understand the language."

"That's incredible, Sheldon!" Lorne was visibly impressed. "This will open up so many avenues of research!"

"*'He cannot say that people want trivia!' is a quote that the founder of the HQ trivia app said to the Daily Beast,*" one of the human podcast hosts pointed out, which caused both Lily and Marie to laugh quietly, separate from the conversation.

"So feel free to take these with you," Sheldon said with a smile. "But keep them secret for now - I don't think these will be a mass-market product..." He turned to Lily. "I must let you know, Lily, that I'll be sharing the data we've created from your sample clips, and likely some of the clips themselves with the scientific community as a result of our development. No doubt they will want to teach your language in schools and the like. But rest assured, your voice and your name will not be coupled with what we have here."

"Sure," Lily nodded, relieved she would get to stay relatively unknown. "I get it. This is... a pretty big breakthrough, huh?"

"Absolutely," Callie nodded. "We're that much closer to translating your ancient materials and things. Now all we need is a cipher to read your written language... Nudge, nudge," she added with a little giggle.

"Another time," Lily chuckled. "Probably better that those 'discoveries' be a little separate..."

"Understandable," Sheldon nodded. "Well, I'm glad it seems to be working out... If I might, Lily... would you please say a phrase in your native language? I'd like to be sure that I haven't just tuned the translator to the voices of these specific people."

"Uhh..." Lily looked about nervously. "I guess..." She thought for a few moment, trying to decide on a phrase but her mind freezing up, put on the spot. The next words she spoke were in English, quoting an internet series from her childhood: "Everyone knows that auto mechanics tamper with the battery, so you have to go back to them in a week. But you can't do jack! Cause they're, y'know, tied! To the... mafia." Lily chuckled to herself afterward, amazed that after so long she still remembered the opening line.

"...Well, that's certainly not a phrase I'd ever expect Lily to say," Marie said in Inkling. "And I swear it doesn't sound completely correct, but I could understand all of the words."

"Yeah, nah, the original quote was like that," Lily told them. "It seems like your translator works pretty well, Sheldon. Awesome stuff."

"Thank you." Sheldon bowed. "Of course, I can't take credit for all of the work. I merely was the middle-man for all the voice samples that were used, and I suppose I designed the translator device based on the research of those I've been in touch with regarding this matter." He smiled warmly at Lily. "Now, their time will likely go toward collaborating with other federal departments to build a framework for teaching this language."

"Oh, for sure. Wait, what do you mean, federa--- ohhh, of course Inkopolis has a government." Lily nodded. "Well, that all sounds fine to me. I think I'm about all set for this journey then."

"Excellent. I wish you the very best in your travels, Lily." Sheldon smiled warmly. "Have you figured out what you are going to ask this Commander Tartar creature?"

"Uh---" Lily was slightly caught off guard by his knowledge of Tartar, but she reassured herself that she should have realised he would know - the others would surely have kept him up to date. "Well... kinda. All I really planned was to ask if he brought me here, since I get the impression that's what Marina and Pearl think happened, how humans went extinct, and whether there was ever a way for me to return. Don't worry," she said as Callie and Marie raised an eyebrow at her, "Lorne and I have decided that I am not interested in going back. I just want to know."

"Hrmm." Sheldon nodded, a little concerned. "Well, if you get the chance, would you consider asking him where surviving human literature might be found?"

"Are you... even able to use that info, Sheldon?" Marie asked, with a slight frown.

"Not me, no." Sheldon shook his head. "But this human business has put me in touch with a group of researchers all working around the subject of humans and their history. If you were interested in speaking with them, they would know how to use that information best."

"Well, I could at least ask and relay the answer, but..." Lily paused, and her brows furrowed. "More than that, I'll get back to you on."

"That's all I ask. I get that you're still keeping quiet about your history, but I trust the staff on that project." Sheldon smiled at her. "They would take good care to keep your confidentiality intact and identity safe."

"That... sounds like they know about me already, Sheldon." Lily raised an eyebrow.

"Yes, well... as I was told, the right person in that institute recognised the blood and DNA samples that had been taken from you some time ago, and they got in touch."

"Hmm." Lily sighed. "Well, I guess I wasn't gonna be able to keep this secret from *everyone* forever. But okay. Let me learn what I can from Tartar first, and then I'll consider what to do from there."

"Again, that's all I ask. That's all I wanted to know. I'll be taking my leave now. For what it's worth Lily, I hope you find out what you're looking for." Sheldon smiled, bowed, and left to return to his shop.

The girls watched him leave, and Lily leaned back in thought as the others resumed their meal.

And found herself wondering if there was any truth in fiction to the idea of 'alien' creatures being experimented on.

*Surely,* she thought to herself, *I just daydream too much.*
