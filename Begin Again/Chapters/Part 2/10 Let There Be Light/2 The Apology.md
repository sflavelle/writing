Sheldon's ears perked up as the door jingled open, early on a Wednesday afternoon, and after a moment to finish writing something down, he looked up, launching into his usual greeting. "Hi, welcome to Ammo Knights! What are you in the market for?"

"Well, y'know," said a voice he'd not heard in a while. "Looking to change up my play style."

Sheldon looked up, and saw the blue and orange tentacles of the two girls that had entered and were walking up to the counter. He blinked, realising with a start that Lily had entered his shop with Lorne and the Squid Sisters.

"L... Lily? Lily!!" He rushed out from behind the counter to hug the inkling, surprising her and the other Agents. "Are... are you alright? I'm so sorry I..."

Lily blinked, still feeling a little upset at him, but she tried to put on a happier face, not wanting to disappoint him. "I'm fine, Sheldon. I... just needed some time to recover and get better."

"I'm really glad to hear that... I was just... really worried after you stopped speaking to me. I knew I'd messed up, but... Well, Marie's been keeping me in the loop in the meantime, and I'm happy to hear Pearl and Marina are changing their mind about you... But... yeah... Please forgive me, Lily."

"Uuuh..." Lily just stared down at the horseshoe crab whose head was pressed into her belly. "It's... it's okay, Sheldon. What happened back at the hotel was... It was just wild, we weren't gonna be rational. I'm over it though, I think. It's nice to know you care so much though."

"She's been okay, Sheldon." Lorne smiled and bent down to his level. "Yeah, she got roughed up and freaked out a bit, but she spent the last few days off the grid with me. She's doing alright now."

"A...alright." Sheldon stepped back, took a deep breath and a few moments to calm himself. "Well, uhm, how can I help you two today?"

"Lily just hit level 6 earlier today," Lorne told him with a grin. "She's interested in trying something new."

"Oh? Congrats, Lily! And so soon after starting to battle, too!" Sheldon knew full well that many people got there quicker, but there was no need to discourage the girl. "May I see your ID, please? I have to, it's just for verification purposes."

Lily handed over the card, and Sheldon scurried behind the counter to fetch his ID scanner. They heard a pleasant tone a few seconds later, and he came back around with the card. "Yep, I can confirm! So, Lily! Changing it up, you said? At this point you can wield a couple of new types of weapon. You unlocked the Splat Roller at level 3, being a modified paint-roller with a wide splash range, as well as the Splat Charger which is great if you have a decent accuracy and like to hang back. At level 4, you've unlocked the Splat Dualies, a set of two smaller weapons with a combined higher fire rate, and a propulsion system that allows for you to execute a speedy dodge roll!"

Sheldon took another deep breath, and Lily wondered just how often he must go through this spiel. "Lessee what else... Level 5 makes the Blaster available to you, trading fire rate for high damage compared to the shooter class, and you can also take the Slosher for a spin now." He gestured at the literal bucket on the wall. "Which I think needs no explanation."

He turned back around to the group and grinned at Lily. "I'd go more into detail, but look around you - you've got three experts in their class of weapon with you! I'm sure you'll find your weapon of choice, and don't be afraid to ask me if you still need information, or want to try any of these out on the range! Alright?"

"Sure thing, man." Lily shot him a thumbs up, and finally let herself smile.

"Okay then, I'll leave you girls to it!" The crab nodded and scurried back behind the counter to finish sorting coins into the register.

Lily almost didn't know where to start first - there was so much to think about! "God, where do I even start to look?" She wondered aloud.

"Why not consider a Charger?" Marie offered with a grin. "Take out your enemies from a distance."

"What about a Roller?" Callie grinned. "Lots of ink coverage, nice damage output, and it makes a nice blunt weapon in a pinch."

"Come on, girls," Lorne cut in. "Are you actually suggesting to her, or do you just want her to use your weapon?"

Marie raised an eyebrow at her. "I don't have an ulterior motive, Lorne. Though it'd be *nice* to have another Charger user on the team."

"Just saying, all the two of you really know of Lily's strategy is that battle we had last week."

"Well, alright, Lorne, keep your hair on... Lily, what's your playstyle like?" Callie asked. "Lorne's got a point, maybe there's a particular type that might suit it."

"Well... in Turf Wars I'm like, a defensive or stealthy player," Lily said, thinking. "I've been trying to avoid fights when I can, just inking turf, but sometimes if I can't help it, I'll hide in my ink for someone to get close and just pummel them with the Splattershot Jr until either of us splat. In *video games* though, that's another story. I kinda like to get in close, harass, pick off important targets, and get out real fast." She sighed happily. "I made a pretty decent Scout in my time... Not *great*, but *decent*. It was fun."

"Hmm..." Callie considered her. That tracked with the... odd way that Lily moved when the Cap'n had orchestrated his skill test. "The Roller *could* be a good fit for you, as would the Slosher, both have good damage output when used effectively, but if you want to emphasize evasiveness, we should try the Splat Dualies on you."

"What are they like?" Lily eyed the display Dualies, propped up on a shelf.

"Well... we don't really know," Marie admitted. "Callie and I never really tried them, they came out way after we settled on the Charger and Roller. Lorne?"

"I ran with them briefly before I settled back into the shooter class, yeah." Lorne nodded. "They might work well on you, Lily. They're two smaller pistol-like weapons, so you could split or focus your fire as needed, and they have a button on each one that will jet you around a bit, so once you get the hang of using them, it's like an assisted dash to the side. Or forward or back. If you wanna harass and annoy someone on the battlefield, dashing around them and making yourself hard to hit is a good way to do it."

"Okay..." Lily thought on it for a moment. It seemed like it would be hard to get used to the 'dashing' Lorne was talking about, but if they assisted in mobility then perhaps... "Could I... test all three? See what works best for me?"

"I don't see why not," Marie said, tilting her head as she glanced over at Sheldon's counter. "Hey, Sheldon. There shouldn't be an issue with Lily testing out three of the weapons, should there?"

"Not at all!" Sheldon looked up from his work, grinning at them. "What did you want to try out, Lily?"

"I uh, I guess we're gonna see which of the Roller, Slosher or Dualies speaks to me..." Lily had gone back to acting shyly/embarrased, not wanting to take too much time out of Sheldon's day.

"Sounds good! Alright, follow me through the back to the shooting range, girls!" The crab gestured to follow him behind the counter.
