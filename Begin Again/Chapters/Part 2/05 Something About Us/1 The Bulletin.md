## Something About Us

The next morning, like most others, began with Lorne's radio alarm. As always, it switched on at 8AM and the hosts of whatever Sunday breakfast show was actually going on handed off to the news bulletins.

*"Y'all know what time it is!"*

As soon as the voices of Off the Hook came on the air for the live morning news broadcast, both Lorne and Lily tensed, their eyes shooting open.

*"It's Off the Hook, live from Inkopolis Square!"*

"Ah, fuck..." Lily said drowsily, and Lorne, turned the other way in their bed, felt her curl up. "Here it comes..."

Lorne turned over, shuffling in to cuddle her, wrapping her arms just under her friend's chest, holding her close. "They wouldn't, Lily. Just remember... no matter what they say, we're here."

*"Before we announce the day's stages, let's kick it over to Marina for the news!"*

*"Hello! First off, our top story today: A large, ancient four-wheeled vehicle was finally lifted from the roof of the New Albacore Hotel yesterday."*

Lorne heard Lily hold her breath.

*"There are plenty of rumors flying about for how it got there, but here are the facts - The car is still in decent condition, despite some water damage. It's hard to accurately pinpoint the age of the vehicle, as it looks as if it was only made sometime in the last 30 years..."*

"Twenty, but okay..." Lily said quietly, listening intently, anxious, still curled in her ball and leaning into Lorne for comfort.

_"But the script that adorns the vehicle, however, that's the most interesting part! It's hard to tell whether this vehicle is connected to the strange event that struck Inkopolis nearly three weeks ago - you may remember we mentioned several objects that had fallen from the sky - but some of the characters that appear in places on this vehicle match those on the phone we recovered from that event, **and** from old artifacts recovered from human ruins in the past few years!"_

*"We still haven't heard any word on why this stuff looks so much newer, though. What's up with that, Marina?"*

*"That's venturing back into rumors, but we're chasing it up with persons close to the situation."*

*"Yep! So y'all, if you know a girl in blue named---"*

*"Pearl, we can't do that, there's regulations about that. Folks, we'll keep you updated as---"*

*"They need to know that---"* Suddenly Pearl went quiet.

*"Whoops\~! Guess Pearl's mic is uh, malfunctioning there. She'll be back shortly. Anyway, moving on---"*

*"We'll find you, Lily!"* Pearl called out, yelling but quiet, distant, as if only caught through Marina's mic.

Marina, for her part, ignored the comment and moved straight along to the next story.

Lily stared up at the ceiling, fear creeping back into her thoughts. Her breathing began to quicken as her mind went wild with thoughts about what was still in store for her.

"Lily?"

They basically told the whole world what she was with that piece, her panicked, overreacting mind told her. They already beat her about, what else were they capable of doing to her? What would *anyone* do if they caught her? If they knew what she was? If they had heard what those two girls had been saying about her kind?

Violence? Assault? Torture? Murder? An image appeared in her mind of her stripped down and bound. Blood was running down her body. Her blood. A lot of her blood.

"Lily...?"

Maybe it would be better if she just gave up. Let them bleed her out. Cut her to pieces. Slice through her body. *Yes, finally. Finally...* Let them *destroy* her. Let them celebrate again. Be safe again. Be *happy* again. Let her death be something to be joyful for. It had to happen.

Honestly, why even wait for them to find her? Why make them work for it? The kitchen was right there. She could just walk over, open the cutlery drawer and---

"Lily!!"

Lorne's hand smacked against her cheek, the impact jolting her back to reality. Lily blinked her eyes several times as she looked around. Lorne was sat up in their bed now, eyeing her nervously. "Whuh? What was that for?"

"You weren't responding to me, and you're starting to hyperventilate..." Lorne reached over and squeezed her hand. "Are you alright? What's going on in that head of yours...?"

Lily looked up at her, noticing her breath was indeed much quicker than it should have been, and her heart-rates too. She forced herself to take slow, deep breaths, wondering what to say to her. *Dare I tell my best friend that I wish I were dead? How would she react...?*

Obviously she couldn't tell Lorne *nothing* was wrong, she'd never believe that. This was not Lily's first dance with depression, far from it. Nor even her first brush with suicidal thoughts. She'd 'grown into' the self-doubt and hatred and such over the last ten years of her human life, but she'd only ever thought about the idea of a world without her, after making a single attempt.

The thing was, in the past the threats were only in her head. The fact that Pearl had actively made threats to her, and had *nearly made good on them*, was almost too much to cope with.

Lily finally sat up on the bed, and clung to Lorne tightly, burying her head in her friend's shoulder. "I... Lorne... I'm not sure I can cope with all this."

Lorne quietly wrapped her arms around Lily again and held her close, cradling her against her warmth. "Come on, Lily. Talk to me."

Lily looked up at her, and sighed, deciding to just out with it. "I... have never really 'liked' myself, Lorne. Not as a human, anyway. Didn't think much of myself at all..." She paused and sighed, tearing up slightly. "It's.. Been better, since I got here, being so far away from all of the things that used to cause those feelings..."

Lorne nodded, stroking the back of Lily's head as she spoke. "But then yesterday happens and... suddenly it gets way too real, huh?"

Lily nodded her head slowly. "I always sorta just thought, but never acted on the idea, that the world might be better without me, that I was a burden that---"

"You're not, though---"

"I *know*, but... Well, I did know..." Lily pulled away for a moment, and stared into Lorne's eyes, worried. "But I'm just associated with... whoever it was now. Tartar. I *am* the representative for humanity now, whether I like it or not. And the fact that for his actions, they seem to want me gone, or dead, or something..." She let out a deep sigh, and learned into Lorne again. "I'm starting to agree with them. I'm causing us all too much trouble. Maybe it would be better if---"

Lorne cut her off, leaning in and softly kissing her lips. It was a brief, gentle kiss, the kind of casual kiss you might give regularly to a long-time lover. "Shh."

As Lily sputtered, flustered, her mind racing with questions, and yet wondering if she was reading too far into it... Lorne held her close, speaking softly. "No way. It's better for you, and us, and the *world*, if you keep living, and don't let their hate get you down." The way Lily seemed right now, she was a totally different squid to the one she'd known as of late... She told Lily, "Don't worry about Off the Hook. As Marie said yesterday, when we talk to them, I'll be right there with you. And I'll make sure they know that she has friends that would hate to see her hurt like this again. Just... remember this. You are loved. We love you." She closed her eyes for just a moment, taking a deep breath before staring into Lily's eyes, trying to seem as truthful and genuine as she could muster. "We'll get through this together. OK?"

"...Okay," Lily said quietly, with a blush, unsure how to respond.

Lorne smiled softly at her. "Good. Now c'mon, let's get up and get ready. I wanna try that new caf√© place down the street."

"A coffee of some description *would* be nice..."

"Great." Lorne slid off of her side of the bed. "Dibs on the first shower!"
