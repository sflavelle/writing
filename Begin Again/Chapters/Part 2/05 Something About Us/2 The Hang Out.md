As the girls entered The Deck, the recent addition to the food and coffee industry in the suburb of West Inkopolis, Lily grabbed a table outside while Lorne grabbed their drinks.

*Inkopolis is a strange city*, Lily thought once again as she watched the traffic pass by. She didn't feel like she was too far from the CBD, but the buildings here were less densely packed. There was still plenty of traffic here, especially on this arterial road, but there was plenty of land here dedicated to small parks, or play equipment, or just... nothing. It was nice to see that not every bit of space had to be either traffic or building.

"Whatcha thinkin' there, Lily?" came Lorne's voice as she brought over their drinks, a latte for herself, and a hot chocolate for Lily.

"Thanks, dear," Lily smiled at her, taking a hold of her drink. She gestured to the street. "I'm just thinking again, how nice and aesthetically pleasing the city is. It makes it easier to think about living here than... out in the country."

"Mm." Lorne smiled at her. Lily figured she didn't really know what she meant, but that was okay. She never expected her friends to understand what she meant about her old world. "So, what do you think about this shop?"

Lily thought on it. "The people here seem relatively nice. I like what I saw of their design inside. Having a space outside is nice, I get to watch the world go by."

"Yeah, we should come back more often. I know you're not much of a morning person, but, y'know..."

"I'm not a morning person, but I'm always down for coffee." Lily smiled and took a sip of the hot chocolate. *Mmm\~!* The chocolate was rich, it just needed a little sugar. She took a sugar packet from a cup of packets provided on the table, emptied it into the hot choc, and stirred. A second taste proved it had given her the lovely, sweet taste she craved.

They sat and drank quietly for a bit, and Lily's mind found itself wondering about Lorne's kiss earlier. They were close, she knew, but that was the first time they had had any kiss. She found herself thinking that she liked that... Come to think of it, they'd been really close for a while, hadn't they? Would she be OK with the idea of them being together?

"Hey... Lorne?" Lily shyly, quietly said.

Lorne could see that she was blushing, perhaps had been for a bit. "What's up, Lily?"

"We're... pretty close, right?"

"Wh--- I would hope so, you silly thing!" Lorne giggled and sipped at her coffee. "I mean, we share an apartment, I've known you since you arrived... or were re-born, or whatever you wanna call it... We even share our bed, for goodness sake. Is... Is this more of your depression from earlier?"

"N-no, I promise, just..." Lily was quiet for a moment, drinking from her hot chocolate as she debated to herself whether she should say... She didn't want to potentially damage their friendship... relationship? If she said it and her friend took it the wrong way... "Are... Are we... a thing?"

"A... thing?" Lorne was confused for a moment by the generic wording. Her brows furrowed as she thought back on Lily's questions, trying to find the context. Then her eyes widened as she realised what Lily was asking. "Like, a couple?"

Lily's face somehow reddened more as Lorne put the word out there. 'Couple'. It was a nice sounding word... "I, uhm... I don't think we've ever talked about it, but we... This morning kinda... made me realise, the way you were just, there for me... it was like we were always that close, and just... grew... into it the more we understood each other... I'm just, kinda worried that you like me for being human, or having used to be a boy, and I'm not sure I'm either anymo---"

Lily cut off as Lorne's hand brushed against hers on the table. She glanced up into the eyes of her friend, and saw concern and worry in her eyes. Like this morning...

"Lily."

"...Yeah...?"

"Relax. Drink your drink." Lorne smiled warmly at her, taking another sip of her own drink.

The conversation paused while they drank, and Lily felt rather flat, panicking again. *Now I've done it... I shouldn't have said anything, it was only a matter of time before I'm kicked ou--*

"Yeah, I've thought about us as a couple." Lorne suddenly said. Lily's eyes went wide, and she opened her mouth, probably to object on the basis of her being awful or something, but Lorne raised a finger and she kept quiet. The orange squid wasn't done talking. "Yeah, when we first met I... I thought it was incredible that I was friends with a real live human. Why wouldn't I be, right?

"But... It was when I first got back home after retrieving the Great Zapfish..." Lorne took another sip of her drink as she recalled. "I'd splatted so many Octarians without much thought, and took on Octavio, *and* Callie head on... and yet, that night when I opened the door, and saw you snoozing peacefully in my bed..." She snorted, in disbelief at herself. "I had the warm and fuzzies, but I remember I just... was more nervous than I was battling all of them."

"Nervous?" Lily raised an eyebrow.

"I didn't want to wake you. You were hurting - I remember that was the night you found out you weren't human at all anymore - but you seemed... more relaxed in sleep, maybe happier when I got in that night. I wanted to be close to you. I'm glad I managed to get in without waking you, really. And my... appreciation and love for you just sorta... grew from there..." Lorne blushed as her mind ran back through their interactions. "So... yeah... I've uh, thought about us as a couple. I um... I think if that ever happened, I'd like that."

"Even with... everything that I am?" Lily looked at her, a little awed, mouth ajar.

"Everything that you *were*. We're not out of the woods yet with this human stuff, clearly, but... You've fit in as an Inkling so well. I am comfortable saying that you're one of us, maybe you were destined to be or something." Lorne smiled, pausing for another sip. "But for what you are, and were, that is who I've fallen in love with."

Lily blushed deeper, and shyly twiddled her fingers together. "You're... very well spoken sometimes, Lorne. I... honestly would love to have someone to love." She gave a soft smile, and shyly leaned in a little closer, cheeks burning. "If... if you want to... I would be happy with us... being that."

"Of course!" Lorne laughed, and she pulled Lily's head forward for a kiss, both girls feeling relieved and their burdens much lighter. Lily smiled up at her, and Lorne could see that, at least for now, her sadness and her pain were very far away from her thoughts. *As it should be,* she thought.

It was after that fleeting moment, when Lily drank the last of her hot chocolate, that she noticed a male/female couple eyeing them and was suddenly aware again of their location, and Lorne laughed as she blushed furiously and buried her head in her arms on the table.
