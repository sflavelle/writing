He remembered one evening three months back, when Lily had come to visit with 'exciting news'. It had come after a month of silence from her, or anyone.

DJ Octavio remembered the narrowed eyes he had given the inkling girl who had come up to him. "Hmmph. I thought that you would perhaps visit more often, human."

"Well at least you recognise me." Sitting cross-legged on the ground before him, once again stunned by his bulging green-purple eyes, Lily watched him carefully. "I can't stay long this time, but I figured you might have some input on something."

Without missing a beat, Octavio quipped back at her, "You could get in here with me, and I'll give you *plenty* of 'input'." His face shifted into a huge smirk and he shifted one of his tentacles to press teasingly against the glass of his snowglobe.

"Oh! Oh jeez!" Lily flinched as she realised what Octavio was implying. "I've *no* real desire to know about *or* add to your escapades."

"Gyahahah! Why not?! You'd consider it though, right\~?"

Lily sighed, but her only response to the question was a moment of silence and awkward shifting about. That told him everything he wanted to know, and his eyes brightened in delight.

It was no secret among the educated inkling populace that Octarians reproduced asexually by cutting their tentacles. That didn't stop the more intelligent ones from mating for fun. Hell, the DJ himself had indulged on occasion.

And though he knew inklings took relationships of such a nature much more seriously, knowing that the ex-human seemingly wasn't opposed to fooling around gave him something to think about.

And it gave him leverage for a future attempt to get himself free.

"...*Anyway*," Lily finally said, changing the subject, clearing her throat. cheeks flushed. "I... jeez. I thought you'd want to know that the club I played last night got back to me, they want me to do do a biweekly set. I think your DJing tips did the trick, Octavio. Can I call you Tavi?"

"You may not," Octavio smirked. "I'm still royalty, you know." He prodded the glass between them. "And I'm not a pioneer in the DJ space for nothing. You get any of the gear I recommended?"

Lily shook her head, still a bit flustered. "I got a mixer, that's about it. I've been lookin', but my knowledge around a computer setup has been fairly sufficient so far."

"You'll regret that eventually," the Octobot King countered, eyebrow raised. "Regardless of anything, you'll want to learn that equipment. You still pre-making your shows?"

"Yeah... mostly. It's just the way that I figure out mashups, is all."

"Kiddo..." Octavio didn't look very impressed, but still seemed to be thinking on it. "Those mashups are kind of your thing, are they? I think that's all I ever heard from you."

Lily nodded. "I consider that the whole 'thing' about my sets, yeah."

"Okay, so... hm.. Interesting. Perhaps then, pre-make your mashups, then mix them live? Gives you something to do besides tweaking knobs and settings."

"I suppose..."

"And hey, here's something I want you to try - set yourself a goal to make them live. With enough practice your crowd won't notice the difference. Heck, \*I'd\* be interested in seeing that."

"Wow... Thank you, Octavio." She found herself smiling at him.

"No sweat." The DJ smirked back. "What else has been happening?"

"Really?" Lily seemed genuinely shocked. "You *never* care about my day-to-day life."

"I care!" He responded loudly. "Sometimes."

"Pssh."

"Besides, you're more fun to hear about than the others." He cocked his head to one side. "It's interesting to hear your unique world view."

"Heh." Lily chuckled softly and smiled. "Alright, well... Oh, y'know what? I wanted to create a style for myself after I got the big news. So, this is what I ended up buying for myself for my --- er, 'DJ Neu Wave'!" She grinned, and slowly turned herself around.

Octavio examined her carefully, curious. She'd donned a black leather rider's jacket, with an image in reflective pins in the back. She'd also started wearing a different glove over her right hand to match. He still didn't know why she wore it...

She still seemed to be wearing striped spats, but it worked on her. Perhaps more than she wanted, he thought as he eyed the inkling's butt for just a moment longer, his gaze snapping back up to her face as she turned back to face him. "Not bad, kiddo. I think your long hair is working against you now, though."

"Is it...?" Lily bit her lip and cupped the ends of her tentacles in her hands. "I mean, they've been awkward to deal with at times... I just thought that was something I had to adjust to and live with."

"I don't know what your fellow inklings do with their tentacle care, Lily, but take a page from us. Why not just cut your hair?"

"Won't that hurt?" Lily's brow furrowed with worry and concern.

"Will it?" The octopus shrugged his tentacles. "Doesn't hurt that much for us Octarians."

"You're... basically cutting off your limbs though."

"And? They grow back."

"They do *not*." The inkling sighed in disbelief. "Stop bullshitting me, Octavio."

"You seriously telling me you've never cut your hair before?" 

"This isn't hair, Tavi. They fill the same purpose, but it's *not*."

Octavio raised a few of his scarred tentacles, presenting them to her. "Look. Sure these are partly damaged due to the war, but I promise you I have severed my tentacles a few times in the name of continuing my species. And I bet you you've seen at least a few inklings with new hairdos."

Lily stared at the appendages in silence for a few moments. "...Okay, that seems a bit obvious now, I guess. Boy do I feel stupid."

DJ Octavio chuckled, raising an eyebrow. "Seriously. If you don't like your hair length, try trimming it down for a while and see how you feel."

"I might..." Lily spoke softly, nodding her head.

The two were silent for a moment, watching each other, relaxed. The cool night air blew through the Hideout.

"Man... I guess I should get back into town," Lily sighed, disappointed. "I promise I'll keep in touch more, Octavio. After all you kinda made this happen."

"You'd better, kiddo. And hey ---" DJ Octavio shouted as Lily started to turn away, toward the grate back home. "Think you'd ever play a show on our turf?"

Lily tilted her head and considered it. "I don't see why not," she answered after a few seconds. "If you behave, of course."

With a smirky grin and a wave, Lily turned, shifted form and dropped into the grate, swimming back to Inkopolis.

DJ Octavio eyed the grate for about a minute or so.

Waiting to make sure the human had gone.

His mind began to turn, plotting out scenarios involving Lily and him.

And a pair of shades.
