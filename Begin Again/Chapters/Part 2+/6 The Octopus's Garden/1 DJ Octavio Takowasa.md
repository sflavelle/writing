## The Octopus Garden

DJ Octavio Takowasa, The Octobot King, leader of the Octarians, scourge of the Squidbeaks, and various other titles he'd given himself, was bored.

This wasn't entirely unusual, considering just how long he'd been incarcerated.

For nearly eleven months, he'd been kept in this damned glass prison, locked away from his kingdom, from any sort of society. The only people he'd seen on a regular basis were those blasted New Squidbeak Splatoon agents. Even Craig Cuttlefish had visited every once in a while, trying to reminisce about the 'old days' before the war. The fool.

For months the Squidbeak agents One and Two - the Squid Sisters - would check in to make sure he hadn't escaped, wasn't planning something. He had tried, many times, to get them to open up about their feelings, about their day, as Callie had once - the one time that had allowed him to overpower her and free himself. But it seemed they had figured out his game, and refused to interact with him on those terms.

But even they, eventually, got bored with him as they realised he wasn't going anywhere, and stopped showing.

There was one of them, however, that continued to visit him, and made living in this prison more bearable.

Lily the ex-human had started visiting at least once a fortnight once that business about 'Commander Tartar' had faded away.

He had expected her to be odd. What he hadn't expected, and was surprised to discover, was that while the other inklings didn't dare to talk to him at length, she was okay with talking to him, answering his questions about her old life, and even more surprisingly, treating him as an equal.

Rather than talk down to him for his attacks on Inkopolis, she instead took interest in his 'DJ' title, talking to him about his musical career, and her own interest in performing. Rather than harass him for being the king of a people, she would ask him about Octarian society, educate herself about his subjects.

In return, she shared music from the human world for him, and together they talked about what that world was like. Lily would share food with him - more filling than the rations Callie, Marie or Craig would often leave him. And, incredibly, she seemed to consider him a friend, the more they talked.

It was odd - perhaps it was because she was not of their world, but she treated him as more of a person than the other Squidbeaks would.

DJ Octavio appreciated that.

Even if she *was* still an inkling, on the side of the inklings.

Occasionally he wondered to himself if there was a way to turn her to his side. Or if there was a way to change her form once more, make her an octoling under his command.

For the former, it wasn't for lack of trying.

Octavio would tempt Lily with offers of power, fame, fortune. Would try to talk her over to his side, convince her to help him to escape. And although he had sometimes succeeded in making Lily feel sympathetic for him, usually it only resulted in the same smirk and shake of the head from Lily. "Sorry Octavio. You know I can't do that," she would say, and she'd either change the subject or leave.

She knew where she stood. Even though he *hated* that she had to respect her orders, it impressed him all the same that she did. If he could just get a pair of shades on her...
