Remo had waited quietly, in squid form again, as the girls waited for their train to arrive. Once it had, and they got on board at the rear of the train, the boy followed them in, choosing a spot not too far away from where they sat, with plenty of room to lay down. Using his mantle as a blanket, he stretched out, like he was back on the Metro. He closed his eyes, pretending to have quietly fallen asleep within a few minutes.

For a little while the ride was uneventful. Every now and then Remo barely opened his eyes to make sure they had not moved.

"Lily...?" Lorne said finally. "If...if Tartar did have a way for you to go home... back to your time... would you take it?"

*Tartar...? I thought they weren't on his side... What did they talk about out there...?*

Remo slowly opened his eyes, just a touch, to watch them.

"It's... complicated." Lily seemed to be taking her time to respond. "I... would love to see my friends again. To see my family again. To let them know I'm OK. To tell them of the wonderful world I've found here. And I... I'd kind of love to be able to show you the world that I lived in. But...if it was a one way thing, if I couldn't come back, or if I had to be an inkling forever, trapped in that old world... I just couldn't. Not anymore."

*Interesting. She seems to enjoy this world. Tartar certainly didn't. I guess Marina's right. Still so odd though...*

"I do miss them," Lily continued. "A lot. But I think I've been more successful under my own power in this world than I ever was in my own. And I have you, of course. And the others."

"Okay... I just... Is it bad of me to think that when you were talking about asking if there was 'a way back', that you still wanted to leave?"

"...No, I don't think you're wrong to think that..."

Remo continued to listen quietly, closing his eyes again. He was satisfied he was watching the right people.

"I'm committed. To this team. To you." Lily gave a deep sigh. "I just... want to know if that option was always there."

Lily and Lorne (and Remo) disembarked at the Inkopolis West station and quietly shuffled toward an apartment complex, Remo stealthily following behind the others.

As they climbed the floors, Remo wondered if they must live together. He wondered how long that had been going on, and how long they had known each other.

Remo finally saw them enter one of the apartments, and Remo, knowing the answers were so close he could almost grasp them, strode toward the door quickly.

He caught the door as one of the girls was closing it, and gently pushed it open a tad to see who was there.

He was face to face with Lily, and she didn't look thrilled.

"Excuse me, 1AM is not the time for visitors. If you really need to talk to us, there's..." Lily went quiet for a moment, realising that they had just seem him on the train. She scowled. "*Excuse me,* what are you doing following us? If you try anything, we're the wrooong people to fuck wi---"

"I'm not going to try anything," Remo quickly said, raising his palms. "But I need to talk to you. ...And I also need a place to stay for the night. I don't know this part of town."

"No chance. Goodnight." The ex-human waved him off, but he didn't move, *wouldn't* move.

He decided to take a chance. "Agent 5."

Lily blinked, and for a brief moment her face showed fear. Then it settled back into its previous expression. "Excuse me, *what*?"

"Agent 5. Real name Lily." Having thrown her off, he took his chance and pushed the door open, seeing the other Agent in the bed at the opposite end of the apartment. "And your friend, Agent 4, real name Lorne. I need to talk to you both."

He expected a reaction, but he didn't expect the way that Lorne had gotten up, walked to him and yanked him inside. "Okay, who the *fuck* are you," she said with a scowl, face close to his, "and why are you at our door in the middle of the night?"

Remo easily forced her hands away from him, and stood back, as he untied his mantle from around his neck and slipped off the hoodie. "I'm sorry to pull this on you so late. We only just got back a few hours ago, and only just found where you all were, but I had orders to find you..."

As the hoodie came free, he pulled his Hero Headset from its pocket, and watched as Lily's and Lorne's mouths fell open.

"My name's Remo. I'm Agent 3. Captain Cuttlefish has asked me to come find you."
