## The Interview

If you wanted to know the history of evolution and the creatures that roamed the planet, you would go to the Shellendorf Museum.

If you wished to learn about the weapons and traditions of the Turf War, you would visit the Skipper Pavilion.

But if your interest was in life before modern marine civilization... You'd visit the Tentaport Institute of Humanities.

Tentaport collected scientists of different disclipines under one roof - biologists, archeologists, linguists, historians and more - working together toward a common goal.

The understanding of the human race.

Since the uncovering of a fossil five years prior, excitement among the scientific community had peaked at the opportunity to study and learn about a completely new species.

As they learned more and more, some dreamed of the opportunity to speak with a human from that time period.

*'Hah, like that could ever happen.' Maybe there is a Cod out there...*

Senior researcher and project manager Mia Tura, an adult Inkling, stared at the notes on her desk. A list of talking points sat on top of the messy pile of documents. A list of talking points planned for an interview she was about to have.

The most important interview of her career.

It had begun with a strange event over two months ago that had seen odd impacts around Inkopolis and the surrounding country. The announcement from current pop idols Off The Hook that one item recovered from these impacts was a mobile phone device unlike any they had seen had set off rumblings within Tentaport.

Then came a call from a colleague in the South-Central Medical Lab, some time later. A labelled blood and DNA sample in refrigeration had caught their interest: 'Inkling DNA sample, unknown virus'. They had found the researcher in charge of those samples, had read through the notes, and recognised a familiar DNA pattern in the isolated cells, one that (barely) matched with samples taken from the bones archeologists had excavated.

They had contacted Mia, provided the documentation, and together they had worked through it to trace down the provider of the samples: a horseshoe crab who ran a Turf War weapons shop in Inkopolis Square.

The impetus to reach out though, came after this 'Sheldon' fellow began to collaborate with other teams in Tentaport, and started to provide *human speech recordings* in hopes of fast-tracking a translation device. Some ancient recordings, and some clearly from a female inkling, speaking a phrase and then translating.

Mia had to know who this inkling was.

Despite their interest and the offerings of a financial reward, though, Sheldon would not reveal the subject's name or details for some time, and denied that there was anything special about them.

Mia had left a name and contact number, in case he changed his mind.

And only two weeks ago, Sheldon seemingly had. The 'truth', as he told it, was much grander than Mia had dreamed.

For 'Lily' was not simply a human enthusiast, had not just mastered the human language, was not simply collecting and restoring items from the human era.

Lily was, supposedly, born *from the human era* and was living among them as an inkling.

"*They're a bit shy, and would prefer to stay out of the public eye,*" he had said over the phone, "*but Lily has consented to talk with you. I will ask her to contact you when she is ready.*"

Which led her to today. Lily, an Inkling with human DNA (or rather, an ex-human Inkling), would shortly be sitting across from her *at this desk* and answering any questions she had.

And she had a *lot* of questions.

The phone at her desk rang. Mia picked it up. "Mia speaking."

"Hi Mia, are you expecting a Miss Lily Sunden today?"

*Hoooo boy. Deep breaths, Mia.* "Yes, has she just arrived?"

"That's correct."

"Alright... send her in." As she said that, looking about her office, she thought: *This place is in no condition to receive a guest.* "Actually," she quickly interrupted, "direct her to the gardens. I will meet her there."

"Alright... will do. Thanks." The voice of Tentaport's receptionist clicked off.
