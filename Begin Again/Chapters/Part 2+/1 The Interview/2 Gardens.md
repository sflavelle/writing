The gardens that the Tentaport facility surrounded were also an exhibition of the discoveries that had been made. Human skeletons, fossilised contraptions, and recovered signage and objects from the human era were displayed proudly amongst beautiful flowers and hedges.

Mia walked through the gardens, clipboard in hand. She quickly found an inkling wearing the 'Guest' lanyard staring in awe at the original human fossil, recovered all those years ago.

"Good morning, madam," Mia called as she approached, and the guest turned around. "Are you Lily Sunden?"

The girl wore a soft pink hoodie, and a blue tee underneath - Icewave, Mia believed. Today she was wearing black jeans and neon green sneakers. She had long, light-blue tentacles that hung lazily from underneath a beanie.

And, oddly, Mia noted that the inkling's right hand was covered in a black driver's glove. *A fashion statement, perhaps?*

The inkling girl nodded shyly, and bowed. "You... must be Doctor Tura?"

Mia smiled. She recognised the voice from Sheldon's samples. "That's right. It's a pleasure to meet you." She glanced around - the gardens were nearly empty. "If I may ask, your contact Sheldon, he did ask you to bring some proof of your identity, yes?"

Lily nodded again, and looked around. Making sure nobody else saw, she slowly pulled a device from her pocket and placed it carefully in Mia's hand.

Mia examined the device carefully. It seemed to be a display of some kind. Pressing the single button on its front lit up the screen and revealed its true nature.

It was a mobile phone. And on its display were characters she recognised from ancient texts.

This girl was the real deal.

Mia handed the device back. "Thank you. Wow. I uh... I admit I was quite skeptical about your credentials." She gestured at some taller hedges in the corner of the garden. "There's a meeting area nearby where we can talk in private, if you like."

Lily nodded. "Lead the way."
