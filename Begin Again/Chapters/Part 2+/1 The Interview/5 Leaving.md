Lily stepped back out of the front doors of the Tentakeel Institute of Humanities nearly two and a half hours after she had entered them. She had poured as much of her knowledge of the old world as she could to the chief researcher who had sought her out.

And before she had left, she had given them the means to decode even more discoveries and knowledge from the human era.

She turned briefly to face the building again. She wondered what they would find first.

She pulled out her main phone. It was an inkPhone like most squids owned, and she'd put a snazzy retro case on it.

*First things first.*Â She opened the camera on the phone and took a selfie standing in front of the building, pulling her hoodie up as she did. She sent the resulting photo to her partner, with the message 'Just got out, how's Ranked treating you?'.

Then she plugged in some earphones, started up a music playlist on the phone, then popped the phone in her pocket and began to stroll along the street, blending in with the marine life walking along the sidewalk as she made her way toward a train station.
