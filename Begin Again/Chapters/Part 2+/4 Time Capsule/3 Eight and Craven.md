The wind whipped past Eight's lone tentacle as his craft raced over the waves of the Inkopolis Bay.

The speedboat he had been loaned from the Squid Sisters had been stored in a private dock down the other end of Port Mackerel ever since a music video shoot three years ago, he'd been told. The only time it had been used since then was when they had taken Lily to the Statue.

Now it was his turn.

He felt nervous as the destroyed Statue grew closer. The last time he was here, the fate of the world hung in the balance. Even now, looking at the damned thing brought up awful memories of Commander Tartar (may he rot, forgotten in that forest).

He slowed the vehicle as he grew closer, and briefly turned his attention to the bag he had brought along. Opening it up, he removed Lily's laptop and phone, and set it on the dashboard of the speedboat. They were already powered on.

Now he just needed to wait for a signal.

The boat came to a halt alongside the sunken statue, on the side nearest an antenna that hung overhead. If Eight was going to get anything, he figured, it would be there.

The Octoling opened the laptop, entering the password Lily had given him. He did the same with the phone, and then followed the instructions she had given on how to activate the phone's network hotspot.

As she had told him, if there was a signal, the phone would broadcast it, and the laptop would automatically connect to it.

Eight sat and waited anxiously.

A soft noise sounded from the laptop.

Leaning across to it, he saw that it was starting to get notifications.

It *seemed* to be working.

He smiled.

*What was it Lily said to do first...? Oh, yes, look at their version of the internet.* Eight looked around the screen of Lily's laptop for the icon she'd told him would be for the internet. Finding the old-fashioned compass on the screen, he opened the application, which greeted him with what he recognised quickly as a search engine.

*What to ask...?*

He stared at the search bar for a minute or two, wondering what to ask first.

Carefully, considering his thoughts, he typed his first question.

'Do humans like other creatures?'

The search engine helpfully suggested 'why do humans like other animals', and he decided to accept its suggestion, submitting his query.

The first pages that showed up were an... interesting mixture of different opinions. 'Why Dogs and Humans Love Each Other', 'Why People Care More About Dogs Than Humans', 'Humans are nowhere near special'.

Eight didn't click on any of them, just read the little blurbs the search engine gave him for each. It seemed that they *were* capable as a species of liking non-humans. *Which explains Lily*, he thought to himself.

*I guess Commander Tartar was evil even for humans.*

A noise from the laptop surprised him.

It came from a chat application. Somebody from it had sent some announcement to one of the many groups Lily seemed to be involved in. He brought up the application, and clicked on the top icon from the list. It seemed to bring him to a personal group chat, seemingly a chat with Lily and her friends.

His grasp of English told him that there were a few people online at the moment. 

He *really* wanted to say hello to them.

After a moment of thought, his fingers went to the keyboard and he started typing.

```
Lily> Hello? Is anybody around?
Lily> I think this was the chatroom Lily told me to use...
Craven> Hi there!
Lily> Hello. It is a pleasure to meet you. I hope my English is good.
Craven> Thanks! Yeah, you're good. How are you doing?
Lily> I am well. I am very excited to meet humans! I am a friend of Lily.
Lily> Oh. I should update my name and things. I am not actually Lily. How do I do that?
Craven> Oh right! Uh... hi, Lily's friend. Just right click on your name, and it should have "Change Nickname". Click on that and type in whatever.
```

Eight examined the interface he was presented with. Its sense of design was (duh) unlike anything he was used to. He found the option 'Craven' was talking about through searching for it.

Eight typed in his name, clicked the big 'Save' button, then returned to the chatroom.

```
Eight> Okay, I have changed my name. They call me Eight. It is a pleasure to meet you, again.
Eight> How are you today?
Craven> That's a neat name. I'm doing alright! Just chilling out, mostly. You up to much?
Eight> I have been learning to drive a boat. I got to see many pictures and videos of your time. Actually they're Lily's pictures. I am very interested in human culture!
Eight> I had to drive the boat because of where this network signal is. I don't know if Lily has told you. It is a statue in the middle of the bay. It's a bit of a scary journey. We don't do well with water.
Craven> Oh. Wait, are you an alien? Because that would be awesome!
Eight> An alien? I am an octoling. I live in Inkopolis, where Lily has been!
Eight> She is well, by the way. She could not make it today. She is trying hard to get a job DJing near where she lives.
Craven> ...hold on, I need a minute.
Eight> Okay. I will give you a minute.
```

Eight patiently waited a minute.

Or he would have, because the next message came in about 30 seconds later.

```
Craven> Okay, so... this isn't just Lily tricking me or anything, I don't think. Uh... sorry, this is a lot to take in.
Craven> ...Wait, what exactly is an octoling?
```

*...Oh. Did Lily never tell these people?*

Eight scrolled the chat window upward, hurriedly looking to see whether he'd just given up a secret. Oh carp oh carp oh carp...

Thankfully, some of the conversation between members of the chatroom seemed to reveal that they did know about Lily and Inkopolis.

Eight breathed a sigh of relief, and returned to the present.

```
Eight> Octolings are Octarians that can transform between octopi and creatures with arms and legs!
Eight> Lily says it's a 'humanoid' form. I guess I see why she thinks that.
Eight> It's like how she can become a squid. We are like inklings I suppose, but instead of squids we are octopuses.
Craven> Wait, what?
Craven> Sorry, I don't know anything about octolings or inklings or Inkopolis. Yeah, she didn't tell me she could become a squid.
Craven> Like, I don't have any reason to believe she'd lie about this sort of thing, so... I think I believe you.
Eight> I will try to explain as best as I can...
Eight> Because of things that happened here, she became an inkling. Inklings can turn into squids, though Lily doesn't like to turn into one very often.
Eight> As I mentioned, I am an octoling. We evolved differently, but we gained a similar function in order to become an octopus. We both swim in ink.
Craven> Does it hurt to turn into a squid, or an octopus?
Eight> Inkopolis is the city where inklings live. Mostly inklings sorry. I moved there recently after... that's not important. It's a very big city.
Eight> No. I would have to ask Lily if it hurts her. I remember her telling me it feels 'weird'.
Eight> May I ask you a question?
Craven> Sure thing.
Eight> What is it like to have bones?
Eight> Every time I see human skeletons at the museum I touch one and it feels very tough. Wouldn't that hurt?
Craven> ...
```

*Did I ask a bad question?*

```
Craven> I... don't know how to answer that really. I've had bones all my life, so I can't really compare it to not having bones.
Craven> It's kind of weird seeing skeletons and knowing that one of them is inside of me, but... I guess it's like asking me what it's like to have muscles.
Craven> Does Lily have bones now, or did they... I guess, leave her body when she became an inkling?
Eight> She does not. She tells me she was asleep or unconscious when she changed so she doesn't know what happened. I talked to her and Marie and Four about her change, but they never mentioned anything like that.
Eight> Maybe they... er, melted? Nobody really knows.
Craven> Alright...
Craven> You said you're not good with water, but you can become and octopus and she can be a squid. Why aren't you good with water?
Eight> What do you mean?
Eight> I mean, I know Lily told me humans could be in water, but I don't understand why you're confused about us.
Craven> I thought octopi and squid lived in the water.
Eight> Did they...?
```

*That's news to me...*

```
Craven> Yep, they do. Wait, are you from the future?
```
*...Uhhh... Carp?*
```
Eight> ... Yes, I believe so. Sort of.
Craven> ... well, I guess that's why I haven't heard of Inkopolis before.
Eight> Yeah... sorry.
Eight> Anyway. Since you asked.
Eight> We can't touch the water. I think my grandfather told me once that we used to be able to, but when we evolved arms and legs we apparently lost the ability. Now we sorta... disintegrate and respawn elsewhere.
Craven> Oh, that stinks! How do you get clean?
Eight> Well we do better in oily substances like our ink. So we can still shower and bathe, just with clear oils.
Craven> Ah, that makes sense. Anything else you want to know?
```
*Huh? Oh, wait, yes!* Eight grinned to himself. *There was a reason I came here!*

He had begun to feel slightly annoyed that he had to explain his world and not learn much out of it. But this was the opportunity he was waiting for.
```
Eight> Oh, yeah! I wanted to ask about the things you guys celebrate!
Eight> One of the things I saw from Lily's photos was her and her family looking for these... chocolate eggs I think. It reminded me of this 'Springfest' thing that apparently happens once a year here
Eight> And I was thinking about the things I celebrate, Octivus (apparently called Squidmas up here), that sort of thing.
Eight> Do humans have anything like that?
Craven> Yeah, we celebrate a ton of things! Birthdays, anniversaries, graduation, sporting events, and religious stuff!
Craven> The chocolate egg thing is from a religious holiday called Easter, which is real weird to explain without getting into actual religion and symbolism and stuff that's probably not appropriate for this channel. Craven> Oh, and we celebrate the new year, too
```
*Yeah, on the wrong date*, Eight thought to himself.
```
Eight> New year? Yeah, we celebrate that too!
Eight> Oh so 'Easter' is religious? I wonder if our Springfest is religious...
Eight> Although I guess the Splatfests are semi-religious enough...
Eight> That's really cool though. I'm amazed we do a lot of the same things
Eight> Marina would be really happy to hear that
Craven> Cool! I mean, if you're from the future-ish, I guess it would make sense, although
Craven> What is Splatfest?
Eight> Oh, that's our monthly celebration event. See the big sport here is Turf War. Teams of four battle to claim the most territory over a few minutes.
Eight> Splatfest is that, but over a whole weekend with every team that cares to sign up for one side or another
Craven> Oh man, that sounds awesome!
Eight> Hmm, what was the most recent one again...? Pancakes versus waffles for breakfast.
Eight> It's really fun.
Craven> That's a lot different from how our sporting events go, it's usually just "Team from place X vs Team from place Y"
Craven> Who decides what the Splatfests are about? I'm guessing there's some sort of governing body.
Eight> Kind of...? I was talking to Pearl and Marina about it some time ago, and apparently the Splatfest topics come from a printer... Nobody knows who or what's on the other end, but I guess the inklings made a shrine out of the space it now occupies...
Eight> Inklings are weird...
Eight> It's their shrine for Splatfests. So they just call it the 'Splatfest Shrine'. Something like that...
Craven> That is pretty weird, yeah, but sports are real weird, I guess.
Craven> Next: Who are Pearl and Marina?
Eight> Oh, they're friends of mine and Lily's. They're a musical duo. And the current hosts of the main news program.
Eight> They're really clever and cool... I owe them a lot.
Craven> Ooh, awesome! They seem pretty cool. Hopefully they can help Lily with her DJ stuff.
Craven> She's real good with mashups, maybe they can do a collab together sometime.
Eight> I'm sure they probably will at some point.
Eight> I remember not long after I met Lily for the first time, she surprised them with a mashup of one of their songs.
Eight> And I think they've talked about doing some form of collaboration... but I think that depends on how Lily goes with her DJing, and if she gets a following at all.
Craven> Ah, cool. I have confidence that she'll get there.
Eight> I'm sure she'll be thrilled to hear that. I'll pass that message on to her.
Craven> Yay :-)
```
Agent 8 took his eyes away from the screen for a moment and was surprised to find that the sky was a vivid orange and red as the sun was just about to set over the bay. Had he really spent so long out here just talking?

He was amazed at himself. He didn't know he could lose time so easily just talking to someone on a screen. He looked back at it, and smirked to himself, shaking his head.

*Maybe humans were alright.*

He didn't want to be out on the water when the sun was gone, though. So he sadly decided that it was time for him to say goodbye to the human on the computer.
```
Eight> I think it might be time for me to go... The sun is starting to get low and I would like to be back ashore before it's gone.
Craven> No problem, it was nice talking to you!
Eight> Thank you so much for talking to me! I'm glad there are more humans than just Lily that are nice and not evil.
Eight> Oh, one more thing - Lily asked me to make sure that you didn't tell anyone outside of here about our time and our world. We have already stopped one human creation trying to destroy us... she would rather us not have to deal with more. Is that okay?
Craven> Absolutely.
Eight> Thank you :-) You are very kind.
Eight> I hope to speak to you again soon one day!
Craven> I appreciate it, and I hope to talk with you, too.
