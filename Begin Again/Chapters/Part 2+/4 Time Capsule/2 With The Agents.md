When Lily answered the door at 2pm that day, she was unimpressed with Eight. "Dude, where've you been? The party's been going for nearly two hours."

"The... party?" Eight stared at her for a few moments, searching his memory. "Oh--- Dear, sorry Lily, I..."

"Oh well, just come on in," she said, opening the door for him.

It was Lorne's triumphant return to ranked battle, and she'd been training hard with her new team for the past few months in preparation for the new season. And here she was - her first matches, broadcasted on everyone's favorite 24/7 Battle Broadcast Network.

Callie, Marie and Lily had made a day of cheering on her team from her apartment, snacks and food strewn about the kitchen countertop and around the couch they had gathered around to watch. Remo had joined them earlier and was preparing drinks in the kitchenette.

"*Aaand this match is now underway, the West Inkopolis Warriors versus the Angelsea Angelfish! It's a bright and sunny day here atop the New Albacore Hotel as both teams leap off the mark, firing about to fill their special meters on the way to this stage's sole Splat Zone...*"

"Wooo! You got this, Lorne!"

"Come oooon, Warriors!"

"You go, Four!"

Callie and Marie shared a bag of crisps among them as Lorne's Warriors closed in on the Angelfish, who were holding the Zone. Both turned as Eight entered the apartment. "Heya, Eight!" Callie waved. "Good to see you!"

"Hey there," Marie nodded with a light salute, before turning back to the game.

"Hey, girls. Remo." He nodded at the other boy as he entered. "Lily, I know I just got here, but can I speak to you in private for a moment? Oh," he added as Lily shot him a strange look, "and bring your laptop. I need to show you something."

The two settled for sitting on the bed, and as Eight handed Lily a flash drive to plug in, he explained. "I've just come back from Tentaport. They decrypted the hard drive."

Lily blinked. She had forgotten about that thing. "Whoa, okay. You're forgiven. So what's this about then?"

Eight simply slid the laptop over to himself and opened a gallery application on it, directing it to a particular folder. He handed the laptop back to Lily as it played the Easter video he had found before.

Lily was silent as she watched herself roam around her old yard with her family. Her hands slowly rose to her mouth, and Eight could see she was tearing up, but her eyes stayed focused on the screen.

After that video, the application cycled through various other short videos, which ended on two that made the inkling begin to cry.

The first was a clip she'd recorded from the end of the Justice concert she had gone to -- the *only* concert she'd gone to.

And the second, which made her squeak, was a short clip she had recorded right after. She, or Simon, had gotten on a train after the show and was tired, exhausted.

Remo glanced up in her direction. Seeing the human face on the screen, his brow furrowed, and he walked over to join them.

Lily looked up and saw him, tears welling up, and got up from the bed, walking toward the door.

"Uh-?" Marie glanced up from the TV, and saw her leaving, and then saw the human's face on the laptop screen. She made to get up, but Lily held out a hand.

"Think what you will," Lily said simply, aware she was making a scene. "I'll be back in a few. I need some air." She glanced at the TV. "Keep me updated on the scores."

Then she stepped out.

Marie glanced toward her cousin with a nervous look, then turned to Remo and Eight. "What just happened...?"

Eight was distraught. "I.. don't know! I brought over the data from the Grizzco hard drive to show her and..."

"Lily saw me coming to have a look and I... think that set her off, somehow." Remo was confused and felt hurt.

"Is that... Lily? *Was*, sorry..." Callie was staring over Marie's shoulder at the image on the screen. She hadn't seen a living human before...

"Okay, okay, hold on a moment." Marie eyed Eight. "Eight, you know this place better than the rest of us. Where's she headed?"

Eight's gaze travelled upwards. "She'll be going to the rooftop. It's safe," he quickly added as Callie, drawing her own conclusion, gasped and covered her mouth. "It's fenced up and used as a social space. Knowing her, she'll be staring down at the street."

"*OHHH! What a magnificent play by the Warriors, their opponents are all down and losing valuable time!*"

Marie grabbed the remote and muted the TV for the time being. *Sorry, Lorne.* "Right. Can you go check on her, Three? I need a moment with Eight."

"Uh, yeah, alright." Remo headed for the doorway. "We'll be back."

The girls saw him off, then Marie sat back down at the couch, turned toward Eight. "Take a seat, Eight."

"Um, do you mind if I...?" Callie gestured at the laptop, the human face still plastered on it.

"Go for it." Eight stood from the bed, walking the few steps over to the couch. "You're not mad, are you...?"

Marie sighed, watching her cousin step around the couch and kneel before the screen, leaning onto the bed and unpausing the video player. "No, I'm just confused. So that came from the drive you, Three, Four and Five collected, yes?"

"That's correct." Eight sat on the seat of the couch. "I just picked it up from Tentaport today."

"I see. Why are videos of Lily on there?"

"It's her---" Eight started to answer, and then stopped, his mouth falling open. "Wait -- you *know* that's Lily?"

Marie nodded, smiling. "I saw her briefly, before she became one of us."

"Huh. ...uh -- it's her hard drive. I thought she'd want to see..." After a moment, he muttered, "and I had some questions..."

"Right." Marie nodded. "I mean, we all still have plenty of questions about humans. But..." She thought for a moment, and briefly glanced at Callie watching the laptop, enraptured. "So maybe... she just forgot we were all here and had a moment?"

Eight shrugged. "She seemed really into it, so maybe..."

"Not your fault then. Are you doing alright, by the way?"

"I suppose... I'm not sure I can ask her now though."

"Maybe I can ask on your behalf." The Squid Sister raised an eyebrow on your behalf.

"Oh, that might be nice... Well, I wanted to ask her if..." Eight took a breath. "If there was some way I could learn more about them from her."

"Hmm. Oh! Why don't you get her to take you to the NILS Statue?"

"Wait, NILS?!" Eight's eyes went wide. "I thought she had nothing to do with them!"

"No, no -- she doesn't," Marie quickly reassured him. "I mean, well -- that statue is most likely still broadcasting a signal from the past. She took her phone and a laptop there when a few of us went for her protection and ended up talking to \*real\* humans."

"Really?!" That seemed to cheer Eight up. "I would love to speak to one..."

"Organise it, then." Marie smiled. "She'll probably appreciate a reason to catch up with some of her past friends, anyway."

"Uuuhm... okay..." Eight nodded, but he seemed nervous still.

Marie seemed convinced in him though, and so she'd unmuted the TV. She and Eight watched the battles on the TV while Callie was distracted browsing the laptop.

Lily and Remo returned a few minutes after, the female seemingly recovered from her moment but now embarrassed. She apologised to everyone and kept to herself for a while as they watched the battles.

Having the gang all together to cheer on Agent 4 as the racked up the wins (and close losses) really warmed Lily's heart. She hoped that Lorne was as energised by her streak as they were, supporting her.

At some point, the coverage on TV shifted from the lower bracket Lorne had started on to a top tier. The crew, having eaten all the snacks, hung about for a bit longer, chatting with each other. By that point Lily had gotten over herself and was talking quietly with Callie about future social activities.

As the group filtered out, saying their goodbyes, Eight finally worked up the courage to walk back up to Lily as she was seeing Remo off. Callie had already left, though Marie was hanging about in the kitchenette.

"U-uhm, Lily?" Eight shyly said as she took a sip from the drink she'd left on the kitchenette.

"Hey Eight. You alright?"

"Uhh, well..." Eight shifted about as Lily's eyes turned on him. "S-so... that drive... First of all, I'm sorry about what happened before."

Lily sighed, her cheeks flushing with embarrassment. "I think that's more my fault, but... thank you for showing me those things." She smiled. "It was nice to see that old world again."

"That's... that's okay." Eight smiled. "Listen, I um... Stop me if you want... But.. I wanted to learn more about your world."

"Ah, well..." Lily scratched at her head. "Well I don't know how much I still remember, is the thing... It's been so long, now."

"Oh..." Eight bit his lip, and twiddled his fingers together. "The thing is... Marie said to me a while back that you'd been out to that... Statue. After we went to see the telephone."

"Ah... okay." Lily nodded. Marie must have told him about what happened out there. "So what do you want to do, then...?"

"Well..." The Octoling took a deep breath. "I... would like to go out to the Statue and talk to some humans about the old era. P-preferably ones that won't try to kill me..."

"They're still not alive in this time, Eight," Lily sighed. "Look, to do that you'll probably need my iPhone and my laptop. The thing is---"

"Your phone? Why?"

"Because it's a cell signal that Statue is giving out, not a home wireless network. My laptop can't connect to it on its own. But Eight---"

"Cool! When can we leave?"

"Eight." Lily frowned. "I can't... I don't have the time to take you out there. I'm setting up some new work at the club down the street. I don't know when I'll be available."

Eight's expression dropped. "Oh... can't... can't I go there on my own?"

"W-well, I don't think---"

"I can teach you how to drive our boat, Eight." Marie smiled, having been listening in from the other end of the kitchenette. "I can't spare the time to take you out there for a couple hours either, but I can at least set you up to get the answers you need."

"That works." Eight smiled at the both of them. "Thank you, Lily. Marie. I sincerely appreciate it."

"No sweat, man." Lily smiled at him. "If that works for you, that works with my schedule. I suppose when Marie's got you all set up then, let me know and I'll lend the stuff."

"Sure. I'll be in touch. Again, thank you..." Eight surprised her with a tight hug.

"Whoa, uh... no worries, man." Lily blushed and reciprocated.

With a smile and a nod, Eight headed for the door. "Take care, Lily. Give Four my regards."
