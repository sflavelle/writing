## The Salmon Dance

The boat sailed through the choppy waters as it made its way toward the third outpost they were scheduled to operate at today.

Aside from a single staff member overseeing supplies (the boat was being remotely steered), the only people on board were Remo, Lorne, Lily, and Eight.

All four of them were Agents of the New Squidbeak Splatoon, Agents 3, 4, 5, and 8 respectively.

And unbeknownst to Grizzco, they were on a mission today.

This was their first day taking Grizzco shifts - their 'intended' job was to visit three sites in the territory, cull the Salmonid population as they came ashore to breed and lay Power Eggs, collect said eggs - *especially* the eggs that came from the bigger, more advanced Salmonids, what Mr. Grizz had called 'Golden Eggs' - and deposit them at a collection point before moving on to the next site to do the same thing.

Grizzco work was hard enough - the tiny Salmonids, the Chum, swarmed if you let them get too close and overwhelmed you, and the big guys, the Cohocks, hit hard with their frying pans and would down you quickly. Not to mention all of the horrifying machines and monsters that seemed to form the backbone of the attacks when the team stepped onto the ground, dividing your attention every which way just trying to stay alive long enough to figure out how to take them down to take their Golden Eggs. And the weather here was an anomaly - fog could roll in at short notice, plunging team efforts into chaos, and the unnatural tides sometimes meant there was nowhere to run or swim when you got surrounded.

Lorne was most used to the work, having done this the most. Remo, with all his New Squidbeak Splatoon training and the situations he'd been through with Cap'n Cuttlefish, had become more comfortable with the task, more quickly than Lily or Agent Eight, who had only been trained against Inklings or Octolings and were still reduced to panic and fright when the going got tough and Salmonids began swarming in on them.

Their mission, the one they had been forced to go to Grizzco for, only added stress to the team.

For it was known to the four agents that somewhere in this dreary, unnerving part of the world, was some item from the human era.

And they wanted to recover it before it was lost, or perhaps destroyed.

At the front of the deck, watching and waiting for the next outpost, the next chance to find this artefact, were Remo and Lorne chatting away about the better ways to take down the 'boss' Salmonid creatures. Meanwhile, Lily and 'Eight' sat just outside the cabin and shared one of the few food rations they had been allotted for the day.

Lily watched her coworkers suspiciously.

Callie and Marie, the Squid Sisters, and in a sense her superiors in the New Squidbeak Splatoon, had caught up to her and Lorne and, while talking, had learned that she still didn't remember the latter half of her encounter with Tartar. But more to the point, *none* of the others had seen fit to fill her in from their perspective, not even Lorne.

"She's just not ready yet!" Lorne had protested. "It'll hurt her!"

But the Sisters had, over Lorne's complaints, seen fit to tell Lily what had happened, as the Cap'n had told it to them - how she had been found linked to Commander Tartar, in the process of being cooked alive when the Cap'n, Remo, Lorne, Pearl, and Marina lost her radio signal. How she had 'totally lost it' as Marie put it, attacking him repeatedly with a makeshift weapon until he was totally destroyed, ranting and screaming throughout. And how she had simply keeled over once it was all over, and the others had carried her back to the train station and watched her nervously until they could get her back to Inkopolis and more importantly, to a hospital.

"It seems," Marie finished, "that your actions out there frightened a few of our friends. And perhaps," she glanced meaningfully at Lorne, "they elected not to tell you because they worried you would lash out at them..."

Of course Lily was angry - but moreso hurt. Her trust in the Agents had taken a hit. But in her brief time at Grizzco, the first mission she had taken with the Squidbeaks since their expedition to the Triggerfish Forest, her diminished anger and frustration had turned to a new target: Mr. Grizz himself.

*'Just stay alive til the end of your shift.' God the way he was so casual about saying that...*

"Lily," Eight grumbled, an Octoling boy with his tentacles styled in a mohawk, and Lily snapped out of her thoughts to glance at him. "Why'd you have to go and get one of your things lost in this awful place?"

Lily finally finished swallowing the small bite she'd taken from the bread they were sharing, and offered it to him again. "Excuse you, mate," she told him flatly, her mood shot. "I hope you're joking, because I had no say in the matter, and I hate this as much as you do."

Eight nodded, and sighed, taking the bread. What was left of their will after yesterday had worn away, and they still had two outposts to check out.
