Once everyone had made it back to the Grizzco boat and Eight had disabled the jammer that had blocked Mr. Grizz from guiding the boat, Lily and the others laid on the deck as they were guided back toward Inkopolis.

Once Mr. Grizz had re-established contact with the boat, he was *furious*. His first order of business was to ban them from working shifts as one team. Then, despite having one more outpost to head to, he set about navigating the boat back to civilization. "The sooner you four are off this boat and out of my shop the better," he had grumbled.

The Agents would later leave the Grizzco front into Inkopolis Square, denied their bonuses (except for Lorne, but only because she was a proven profreshional) and head toward the subway station. Eight, having become one of the more technologically-minded of the group, took the drive they had recovered as Lily explained how old drive storage worked to the best of her ability. He would try to repair what he could of it, since the drive was waterlogged.

He left on the train, waving to the others.

They'd find out what was salvageable from the disk, eventually.

Remo, Lily and Lorne saw Eight off, and then headed back and over to Crusty Sean's stall to for a Schwaffle and a drink.

They'd earned it.
