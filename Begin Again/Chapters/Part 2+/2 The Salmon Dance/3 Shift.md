The boat eventually came to a halt between the coast and the wrecked boat, and the single staff member immediately went to work lowering the ship's anchor from the controls in the cabin. "Alright, here's our stop," Grizz remarked. "Get to work."

"...Alright." Lorne nodded to her coworkers, then shifted and super jumped off toward the wrecked boat on the bay.

Remo, Lily, and Eight were right behind her, and as soon as they landed they were off, Remo covering the far side of the coast with a Roller, Eight inking the boat itself with a Blaster, Lorne heading south to ink up some of the beach with a pair of Dualies, and Lily left to cover the docks with her Charger-type weapon.

For Lily, she made a beeline for the farthest dock, closest to the coast, where a buoy gently bobbed just beside it. Inking straight lines with the E-Liter she was given, she raced over there with the bag she had been given, ran up the few steps toward it, then leapt up, lifted her body onto the buoy itself briefly, and deposited the bag, tying it to one of its supports to keep it safe.

Leaping back down, she looked up at it. *No way to see it from down here. Excellent.*

Waiting to charge up a shot was bothersome, but she quickly found that the resulting blast from the E-Liter travelled quite far - enough so that she was able to roughly coat the dock in ink from one end. She spent a minute or so inking up as much of the area as she could, working her way up back toward the beach, where the group were to meet.

"HEY!" The voice of Mr. Grizz barked in Lily's ear, and she winced. "Quit dallying, inkling! Your friends are waiting for you! Go go go!"

*Well he wasn't watching then,* Lily remarked in her head. *At least I don't look suspicious, just stupid. I can deal with that for now...*

She met up with the others down by a basket on the beach two minutes later. "All set?" Remo asked her as she arrived.

Lily gave the group a thumbs up. "All set. Let's do this."

"Noticing a bit more activity than normal around here," Grizz radioed to them. "I'll activate one of the cannons. Profreshional, I want you on that. Cover your friends."

"If you say so, Grizz," Lorne replied, and looked up toward the wreck they were standing in front of, where an odd orb-shape cannon blinked to life, switched on remotely. She began to make her way around the side, up the propeller lifts so she could get to it.

As they heard the cannon above turn on, Lorne manning the control, they all heard the sound of a horn being blown, somewhere off the coast.

The Salmonids were beginning their attack.

They rushed ashore from the leftmost stretch of beach, about ten of the small and regular Salmonids, the Smallfries and Chums as Lorne had told the others. They charged toward the three on the beach in a frenzy as more horns sounded in the background.

Lily, Remo and Eight launched into action. "Behind me!" Remo shouted, leading the charge, Roller down and splatting a line down the middle of the charging Salmonids. Eight followed, Blasting enemies down the side of the charge at any Salmonids that they passed while Lily, hanging back, carefully picked off the more distant targets.

Another horn sounded and Lorne's cannon turned. Over the radio she called, "Lily, take the right! They're coming up there now!"

Lily backed off and inked up a path over to the opposite stretch of beach, where indeed more of the crazed creatures were surfacing. Behind them emerged a Cohock, one of the larger Salmonids Lily had been told about, who looked tough and looked like a heavy hitter with that big frying pan he carried. And behind *him*...

Lily faltered for a moment as she saw the tower of pots rise into view. More and more of them. The collection was at least four times her height. And on top was a... mechanical head of sorts. It whipped around wildly as it searched for something to lock onto.

"There! Get its eggs!" Grizz called in her ear.

But the approaching Salmonids on the ground took Lily's attention first, and she pulled back as she charged up her E-Liter and let off a blast, taking out a line of Salmonids in a line, save the Cohock at the back - though well-inked it wasn't quite through yet.

The fire of a cannon behind her made her jump slightly, and a moment later a blast of explosive ink took out even more of the horde that had made it ashore. A second blast, aimed at the tower of pots, knocked many of them away. "Quick, knock the last few away!" Lorne called over her radio. "Before it can fire off its Sting Ray!"

Lily rushed forward as the Stinger's eyes locked onto the duo of Remo and Eight on the other side of the beach, dealing with their own horde, and flung a Splat Bomb toward it even as she approached. The bomb, bouncing along the ground, detonated quickly and the two pots it still had were flung back into the sea, and the head slammed into the burner at its base and burst, revealing three Golden Eggs.

She ran up to them, grabbed one, and tried to grab another - but found that they were too big for her to do that. She fretted for a moment, wondering what to do...

"C'mon kid! Go!" Grizz shouted in her ear. "Deposit that one and come back!"

"Don't worry, Lily! I'll make sure they can't grab those in the meantime!" Lorne called.

Lily nodded and, leaving another bomb behind her, ran for the egg basket.

Meanwhile, Remo and Eight were taking care of their own rush of Salmonids. Neither had really worked with each other until now - the only idea they had of the other's competence was their battle from what felt like long ago.

It felt strange to Remo to put his trust in an Octoling, even after everything he and Eight had been through. But thankfully, either due to his military training or his time in the Metro, Eight was doing well with the weapon he'd been loaned. The Roller that Remo had been given was doing well enough for the small enemies, such that the two could just mow through them.

"Boss! To our left!" Eight called, suddenly firing at something emerging from the ocean. Remo whipped around, coming face to face with a Steelhead.

Remo's face dropped. They hadn't faced one of these yet. "Lorne!" He called into the radio as he and Eight backed off, firing at the great beast, though their ink splashed harmlessly off its armor. "We got a Steelhead. What's the strategy?"

"Not doing that," Mr. Grizz told them flatly.

"You wanna help them be a better worker or not, Grizz?!" Lorne chastised, hoping her profreshional status would protect her. "Wait for it to start charging a bomb, guys, then attack that!" As she spoke, another boom from the cannon sounded, and an explosive ink round landed among the mass of creatures further back on the beach, splatting and dispersing them.

"Got it," Remo replied, and glanced at Eight briefly. "I'm not sure I can get enough height with a Roller fling, Eight. I'll do what I can to fend everything else off if you can attack that."

Eight met his glance and nodded at him.

And then they both heard the sound of something growing, inflating.

Remo and Eight both turned toward the noise, and saw the Steelhead, and something filling up on its head.

The bomb.

Eight's weapon instinctively snapped back up and he fired his Blaster toward it, even as he and Remo backed away, Eight heading back through their ink and Remo pushing forward through with the Roller.

Despite several good shots on the Steelhead's bomb, it still shot off from its head, toward Eight.

"Three! The bomb! I'm backing off!" Eight called as he zipped backwards in octopus form as the projectile landed where he had been, exploding a moment later in a splash of dark, sickly green, after which he charged back into the fray.

The crew was kept busy over the next half-hour, even as at points the attack lulled and Lily, Remo and Eight were able to briefly regroup underneath Lorne's cannon, sharing encouraging words and checking on how many Golden Eggs they had accrued. Otherwise they worked in pairs as Remo and Eight, and Lily and Lorne repelled the Salmonids.
