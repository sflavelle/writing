And then, suddenly there were none left ashore. The Agents looked around and waited for a minute, thinking it just another lull, but then Mr. Grizz's voice came in over the radios. "Looks like they're backing off. And we got a decent collection of eggs out of it. It'll do. Alright, come back to the boat."

Lily and Eight let out an audible sigh of relief. The former checked her hat. *Excellent*, she thought to herself. She still had both Splashdown charges. She'd need them.

Remo gave her a nod, knowing what was next, and after Lily handed him her weapon to take back, he and Lorne super-jumped back over to the Grizzco boat.

The remaining team, however, rushed away from the beach over to the dock area. As Lily climbed up onto the buoy to retrieve the bag she had left earlier, thankfully untouched, Mr. Grizz radioed them again. "Hey. Kids. Yer done here. And company rules forbid bringing external equipment on-site. Return to the boat."

Agents Five and Eight ignored him. Instead Five radioed to their counterparts on the boat. "Aight Three, Four, I'm suiting up." They unzipped the bag and pulled everything out - the deployable liferaft, the old diving suit and the Tracker. Lily immediately set about putting the suit on, with Eight to help.

"Is that a liferaft FROM MY BOAT?!" Grizz shouted at them. "That's private property! RETURN TO THE BOAT, WITH THAT RAFT! Or we'll leave without you," he finished, threatening them.

She tucked her tentacles into the suit, then fitted the diving helmet on over her head and fastened it to the rest of the suit. She keyed her mic as Eight grabbed the liferaft tube and deployed it into the water next to them, then began to use the Tracker to scan for the artefact they were here for. "We're not deserting. Give us three minutes and our mission will be over. Waters clear, guys?"

Remo, scoped in with Lily's loaned E-Liter, responded, Lorne with a pair of binoculars beside him. "Looks like it. Could change though. Better hurry. Hope that suit works."

"What is going on here?!" Grizz growled in frustration, realising the situation was falling out of his control.

Once Lily was suited up and the raft was ready to go, Eight pointed stood back and nodded. "Good luck, Agent 5," the Octoling said. "I'd better get back to the boat."

Lily nodded as she slid from the dock into the small liferaft. "Make sure he doesn't leave without me," she replied with a smirk.

As she heard Eight super jump away, she nervously took hold of the paddles the raft had been deployed with. *Better work fast*, she thought as she experimentally tested each one, taking a moment to remember how to row, before setting off, rowing as hard as she could against the waters, trying to move fast.

"...So, 'Agent', huh?" Mr. Grizz returned after a few quiet moments of rowing, quieter, calmer but still angry. "Yes, I've heard stories from the war, of the Squidbeak Splatoon and their so-called 'daring missions'. But I assumed you folks had disbanded long ago. Or perhaps," he wondered aloud to her, "you four are slimy hipster wannabes trying to play spy...Trying to follow in the footsteps of your heroes. What're you even here for, anyway? Why're yer disrespectin' my business, my efforts?"

"Oh wh--- Lily, we're starting to move!" Lorne radioed in. Lily's eyes snapped toward the boat, to her right, and saw that indeed it was starting to slowly move off from its position.

"Stop it!" Lily called back anxiously, checking the waters around her again with the Tracker. She was now about thirty meters out, and judging by the clicking of the Tracker, she was nearly above it. She pushed herself to keep rowing further. "I'm almost there!"

"What're yer expectin' to find, kid?" Grizz chimed in again. "You realise that you're surrounded by death, right?"

"...I'm aware," Lily finally replied to him. "But there's something here we need to preserve. An item of the past that we can't lose."

"And? Even if that were true, you realise anything found in these territories belongs to Grizzco Industries? I'm not lettin' ya smuggle whatever it is out of here, not without some compensation at least. Either way, I've decided I'm not interested in sticking around to see if you survive. Thanks for the Golden Eggs. Farewell."

Lily grumbled, pushing harder, rowing as fast as she was able. Even with her friends struggling against the remotely-piloted Grizzco boat, she now had a time limit. Even if she did survive what she had to do... she did not want to be stranded.

"Five! Behind you!" Remo called over the radio, and Lily turned to see...

A bobbing fishing lure, making its way toward her craft.

Maws.

As the boats grew closer together, the Grizzco boat taking a path around the Marooner's Bay to get back to the open waters, Remo let loose a shot of pressurized E-Liter ink that shot into the water, aimed at the creature that awaited just underneath the lure as it grew closer to Lily. It had no effect.

But then the lure disappeared beneath Lily's raft, and her eyes went wide.

"LILY! QUICK! BOMB!" Lorne shouted hurriedly.

Lily did two things.

She unholstered a Splat Bomb from its holster, set its fuse and dropped it on the boat.

And as she did, she pushed herself up and over the front of the boat as she tore open and activated one of the special sachets.

Activating a Splashdown.

Maws made its appearance as she did, crashing through the flimsy inflatable raft and tearing it to shreds, inadvertantly gulping down the Splat Bomb she'd left.

And as she hovered in the air, moments before the Splashdown mechanism would fling her downward toward the ground, she saw Maws burst, cooked from the inside by the bomb. Three Golden Eggs floated in the water next to her, amongst remnants of the raft she was just in.

And then Agent 5 was flung into the water, propelled by the Splashdown's power.
