"Ye'll pull into Marooner's Bay shortly," called the voice of Mr. Grizz, broadcasting over the boat's loudspeakers. "Lookin' clear on the coast, tide's low but not too bad. Yer doin' well so far, kids. Keep it up."

Lily sighed, and once Eight has finished his bite, they set the rations aside and climbed to their feet, slowly making their way over to Remo and Lorne.

Together they watched the beached, deconstructed ship hull come into view, the abandoned refinery and wooded coast just beyond it. The odd towers and buoys hovering nearby... It made Lily uneasy, still.

Lorne bent down in front of the one carry-on they were allowed, on the floor with them, and with the others blocking the supply staff from seeing, pulled out an odd weapon-looking device.

It was a scanner, tuned to a uniquely trackable 'scent' particle that had so far emitted from every thing they had collected so far from the human era.

Lorne held it out toward the Marooner's Bay, holding the trigger down, and panned it in a slow arc, from one side of the area to the other. The others held their breath or crossed their fingers.

And as it pointed toward the small beach on the coast, the scanner started to make loud clicking noises, akin to a geiger counter.

The object they were seeking was here.

"Oh, thank goodness," Remo noted with a sigh of relief. "We've finally found it." He turned to Lily, a relieved but nervous look on his face. "That's something to be happy for, right?"

Lily grumbled. "I mean, *yes*, but I think we still need to actually hold the Salmonids at bay long enough to do what we need to..." She glanced at him with a concerned look, and Remo's eyes darted away.

The ex-human sighed and watched as their Grizzco boat inched closer to their destination.

The two boys had been almost keeping her at arm's length, especially while they were on this mission. They seemed almost scared of her when she started to get frustrated with Mr. Grizz, or the so-called 'Boss Salmonids', as if she was going to start hurting them instead if they interfered.

Lily shook the thoughts away. She didn't need to stress about that just yet. She turned her attention to the workspace in front of her. As the boat swung around, giving her and the others a complete view of the Marooner's Bay, Lorne continued to scan the boat's structure and the area around it, trying to narrow down the location of the artefact they were seeking.

"Alright, get your gear and prepare to go to work," Mr. Grizz ordered them over the speakers. "They're due to start coming up any moment, so DON'T MISS ANY PRECIOUS GOLDEN EGGS!"

Eight and Lily winced as Grizz suddenly shouted the last words, and everyone moved to various parts of the ship to get the tanks and weapons they had been allotted for the day. Lorne, as soon as she was done, rushed to move their carry-on.

As the single staff member on board quickly moved to find fresh stocks of special kits, Lorne approached Lily as she fastened the tank to her back and held the scoped E-Liter 4K Grizzco had lent her for the day, with a moment of just wishing she had something more similar to the weapons she had already used.

Lorne reached over the side of the boat, towards two tall, thin canisters that held legally mandated liferafts. She grabbed one, stuffed it into the carry-on, and held the full bag toward Lily. "Bad news, hun. Looks like it's in the water toward the coast. Stash this somewhere on that side of the worksite, and be ready to move as soon as it's clear. Alright?"

Agent 5 sighed, and nodded, taking the bag. "Alright. Here's hoping that old suit works still. Let's go to work."

"AND WEAR YOUR RADIOS, FOR GOODNESS SAKE!" Grizz barked again, apropos of nothing.

Everyone grumbled, gathering back at the front, fully equipped and radioed up. It was a requirement of the job - Mr. Grizz seemed the type to keep a very close eye on the job, and wanted to be able to hear every word of the team's communications - something the New Squidbeak Splatoon were not thrilled with... but they'd figured out a way to keep their plans secret, at least until they needed to take control of the situation.

"Everyone remember the strategy?" Lorne said confidently, the first words broadcasted back to Mr. Grizz, now that their 'break' was over. "Once we get on-site, spread out, cover the whole space. We need fast movement away from the Salmonids. Once that's done, or if they arrive prematurely, we'll meet on the low terrain. Since it's low tide, they'll likely make landfall there. Then it's just business as usual."

Remo, Eight and Lily nodded. "Any idea how long they'll attempt to come aground?" Remo asked.

"Not over til it's over, rookie," Grizz told them over the headsets, calmer. "Just get as many eggs as you can and stay alive."
