She sank like a stone.

"Lily?!" Eight radioed in in a panic.

"Lily, you alright?" Agent 4 also called in. "Let us know as soon as you can. I don't see your spirit, which I *think* is good..."

The water was murky with a greenish tinge. She looked around as she sank, trying to see anything around her. But she couldn't see a thing.

She got the impression after a moment that her descent had halted, or at least slowed to a crawl. She took the other Splashdown satchel and tore it open, and as it activated she felt the water rush past her as she sank with renewed force.

She was surprised when her feet touched the rocky, dusty ground. Sooner than she had expected. Visibility was rotten - she only seemed to be able to see two meters in front of her. The diving suit was holding up, but the water pressure pushing against her, trying to crush her, was incredibly uncomfortable.

She also realised quickly that she, and her fellow agents, had neglected to find a working oxygen tank for the diving suit. The oxygen she had was whatever had seeped in from the surface.

The sooner she finished this the better.

Agent 5 took steps through the water, working in almost slow motion, continuing toward where the Tracker had last indicated the presence of the artefact. Finally she breathed, "This is surreal... It has to be nearby."

"Oh thank goodness you're alive!" Four called in. "Any sign of it yet?"

"No," Five replied, scanning the area with her eyes - the Tracker would be rendered useless under the water, and so it was fixed to Lily's waist inside the suit. "I can't be far off though..."

The sea floor was nearly barren here. Here and there were vague signs that Salmonid nests may have passed through or lived nearby - frying pans and cooking utensils were the most common thing she saw down here.

She found herself approaching what looked like a nest of sorts. *Uh oh...* she stepped carefully, but couldn't see any creatures about. Not yet, anyway...

And then, among what was seemingly a pile of 'treasure', she saw it.

It looked like a black brick with wires hanging out of it.

It looked like an external storage drive, like those she'd seen in IT stores across Inkopolis.

Carefully, making sure nothing saw her, she picked it up to examine it.Though worn... the text and logo on its top was human.

This was it.

She held it tightly to her and leapt up, beginning to swim back upward, as her lungs began to ache, struggling to find new oxygen in her suit.

"Got it...!" she radioed in briefly. "Coming up..."

"Good work!" Remo said cheerfully. "We managed to stop the boat from moving, so we'll be right here for you. Eight and Lorne are on their way out in the other liferaft."

Agent 5 said nothing in response, trying to focus on swimming upward with one arm holding the device to her. Swimming like this only exerted her more, and she began to feel ill, and the pain in her lungs grew.

With the murky waters, she couldn't tell just how far it was to the surface. How far had those Splashdowns taken her?

The water started to lighten up as she swam, not sure how much longer she would las---

And then Lily broke the surface suddenly and the bright sunlight nearly blinded her as she treaded water, looking around.

"There!" She heard the voice of Lorne nearby, and spun around.

She and Eight were nearby, paddling over to her.

Thank goodness.

She was saved.
