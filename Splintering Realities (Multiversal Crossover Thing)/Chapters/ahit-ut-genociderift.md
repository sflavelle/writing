Just as quickly as the unknown human vanished from his sight behind a pillar, everything *stopped*.

Frozen in place, Sans could only watch as Frisk, the *murderer* that took his friends and life away, also hovered, an instant in time, partway through dodging another wave of bones. A red knife in one hand and a manic grin.

Was this how it ended for him? 

But then, there was a sound that sounded like a click, like someone had pressed play on a cassette player and -

The world RESET.

Except, it hadn't?

It *seemed* like it had RESET - time had clearly rewound again, like it would when Sans had bested the murderer, only for the bastard to suddenly be rushing at him again, dodging whatever attack he had fallen to - but this time *the murderer hadn't been the one to RESET*.

This time, as the two rewound to an earlier stage in their fight, Frisk taking a swipe at him with the knife - Frisk faltered, slipping to the ground.

...as if the RESET had taken him by surprise too -

Sans realized quicker than the human did. Before Frisk could bounce back, before he could strike again -

One well-timed bone pillar struck through the ground with surprising speed, lancing the human through his chest, impaling and lifting him from the ground.

The knife clattered to the ground. Sans quickly swiped it before Frisk could get any ideas, but the murderer's choked breaths and wide eyes told him that, at least for now, the fight was over.

He took a moment, closing his eyes to calm himself. Then, finally, he smirked and opened his eyes toward the impaled human. "rough mistake, huh," he taunted.

Frisk grunted. "...do it, fucker."

"hmmmmm..." Sans made a show of thinking about it. Then he shrugged. "nah, guess you'll just have to live."

Even as the human's breaths labored, he could sense their confusion. he wished he could feel smug as he slowly strolled up to them. "you think i'm stupid, kid? you think I don't know that every time this fight has finished, we go back and do this all over again? nah. see, i've been thinking about this. while we're in battle, you can't reset. and since you're gonna be ticking away HP for the next..." he mimed checking a wristwatch for the time. "...eternity, we're technically still battling."

"now, i'd love to *hang around*, but I have to go deal with the human friend who just fucked you over. don't worry, I'll come back. I'm sure you've got *a lot to get off your chest*."

Smirking, Sans turned away, waving sarcastically as he walked towards where he had seen the human girl in the hat.

As soon as he was no longer facing Frisk, his expression slid immediately into one of depression.

----

Climbing this path around a time rift was nothing she hadn't done before.

What Hat Kid was trying to figure out, however, was why one had materialised here. 

She could only guess it was to do with how Moonjumper and Alex had caused the barrier between universes to shatter, but... how had time coalesced into a rift here, so deep underground? 

She wondered if this place would give her answers to how to even start searching the multiverse for them. 

She shot her umbrella hook toward another grapple point, and swung across to another crystallized time block --

And then suddenly, a skeleton in a blue jacket was there waiting for her. 

Surprised, she landed oddly, having to do a few little hops to prevent falling on her face, or crashing into the monster that had appeared. She let out a small breath of relief. "Nailed it," she murmured to herself, before turning to the skeleton that was watching her with apprehension. "Umm, hi? How'd you get in here?"

The skeleton raised an eyebrow. "i should be asking the same thing, kiddo. just, waltzing in to the underground like you own the place."

She shook her head, as she swapped out her current hat for a Dweller's Mask. "Just here to fix these Time Rifts, then I'll be on my way. One sec." The mask's eyes lit up in green, and the girl vanished. 

Sans looked behind him. There was a block of green floating between this and the next block of solid ground. One that didn't seem to be quite a tangible part of this dimension.

Sure enough, the human popped into existence midway through jumping off the far end of the block, to the next platform. 

"I don't think you understand me, kid," said the skeleton as he was suddenly right beside Hat Kid again, causing her to flinch. "your other friend killed a lot of *my* friends. the underground does not. belong. to you."

Hat Kid paused, her jaw opening, silent briefly. "...Mu did *what*."

"...who?" Sans raised a non-existent eyebrow.

Hat Kid watched him for a moment, thinking. Then she snapped her fingers. "Oh, no, the one you were going to town on isn't with me. Mu's my space travelling partner. We're trying to find a way to fix the multiverse. And we encountered this rift's signature and we Tempus travellers have an obligation to fix them when we encounter them."

He stared blankly at her. "... this is a gag, right?"
