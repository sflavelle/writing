"WOWIE! LOOK! THEY SELL NICE CREAM UP HERE TOO!"

The shouting voice, though not directed at them, made both Sans and Asgore freeze, Hattie confused and looking between the two.

The goat monster watched as the skeletons face shifted from glee to disappointment. "nah... nah, it couldn't have been. there's no way. heh... sorry pops. thought paps was alive for a sec."

Asgore nodded quietly, resting a hand on his friend's shoulder. 

The voice spoke up again, and both monsters could hear that it was coming from around the corner. "YOU MUST BE MISTAKEN, SIR. THIS 'ICE CREAM' YOU ARE SELLING IS CLEARLY THE SAME AS THE POPULAR 'NICE CREAM' DESSERT. WE WILL GLADLY PAY FOR ONE EACH, REGARDLESS."

Sans, despite himself, picked up the pace, unsure what he'd find around the corner. He reached the end of the block, and while waiting for the others, peered through the crowd. 

He recognised the tall figure at the street vendor immediately, and he froze.

It was another skeleton, lanky and young.

It was-

"bro..."

He found himself pushing through the crowd toward him. 

His brother was alive. 

Papyrus was *alive*!

"paps! over here!"

Papyrus turned toward him... and so did the human next to him, wearing a familiar striped shirt and-

And suddenly all Sans saw was a haunting figure, staring him down at the end of a hall, knife out, head to toe in dust and blood, the dust and blood of his friends, everyone he knew, of course they were back, they'd reset after all, they-

His magical energy flared as his fight or flight response kicked in. He had to save Papyrus, he would be okay, he-

"*get away from my brother, murderer!*" He growled as he charged toward them, a long bone weapon forming in his hands as he rushed toward the child and the skeleton both wearing the same expression of confusion and panic-

Then he was enveloped in blue magic, a force crashing him roughly to the ground. He struggled to free himself, a few feet from the two. "nnngh, let me go bro! they'll hurt you!"

"... I'M NOT HOLDING YOU DOWN, SANS." Papyrus' expression was now one of shock, as he held Frisk close to himself.

"then-"

"i am."

Sans froze again.

Slowly, he turned his head toward the source of the voice...

...and was met with himself, palm out, a grave expression in his doppelganger's features.

It took him a few seconds to process all this.

And when he did, he simply let his skull knock against the ground. "God damnit, i'm an idiot."

"Sans," came Hat Kid's voice from behind him, and both Sans the Skeletons looked toward her, still riding atop Asgore's frame as they approached. "I *told* you about parallel universes, 'bro'."

"i know!" he replied from the ground. "i had a moment, okay?"

"hey buddy," Other Sans greeted Asgore, still keeping his target pinned. "this bonehead with you?"

"GREETINGS, KING ASGORE!" Papyrus greeted loudly. Frisk had taken to hiding behind him, peeking their head out carefully "YOU SHOULD HAVE LET US KNOW YOU WERE GOING TO JOIN US FOR NICE CREAM."

Despite the situation, Asgore couldn't help but snort. Trust Papyrus to lighten the mood, no matter the universe. "Yes, I apologise for him. The two of us have been through rather a lot, but we don't mean harm."

"We mean JUSTICE!" Mustache Girl declared beside the goat monster. "Justice for those that lost their lives!"

"...for those that... what?" Other Sans furrowed his... eyes in confusion, glancing toward Frisk. The kid's reply was to hold their open palms out, shaking their head. He looked back toward the group. 

"Mu, if I may?"

"Sup, Asgore?"

"Be quiet for a moment." He sighed. "Sans, Papyrus, Frisk, I deeply apologise. It is good to see you all well. It is simply unfortunate that, in our original universe, it was our Frisk that... slaughtered the monster race."

Papyrus gasped dramatically. Sans' hard expression softened, as he started to realise what would have gone through the other's mind on seeing them. Frisk clapped a hand over their mouth, mortified.

"i saw them and... was reminded of seeing them in the judgement hall, covered in my friends' dust," the Sans pinned to the ground explained. "forgot this wasn't our reality for a moment there."
