Just as quickly as the unknown human vanished from his sight behind a pillar, everything *stopped*.

Frozen in place, Sans could only watch as Frisk, the *murderer* that took his friends and life away, also hovered, an instant in time, partway through dodging another wave of bones. A red knife in one hand and a manic grin.

Was this how it ended for him? 

But then, there was a sound that sounded like a click, like someone had pressed play on a cassette player and -

The world RESET.

Except, it hadn't?

It *seemed* like it had RESET - time had clearly rewound again, like it would when Sans had bested the murderer, only for the bastard to suddenly be rushing at him again, dodging whatever attack he had fallen to - but this time *the murderer hadn't been the one to RESET*.

This time, as the two rewound to an earlier stage in their fight, Frisk taking a swipe at him with the knife - Frisk faltered, slipping to the ground.

...as if the RESET had taken him by surprise too -

Sans realized quicker than the human did. Before Frisk could bounce back, before he could strike again -

One well-timed bone pillar struck through the ground with surprising speed, lancing the human through his chest, impaling and lifting him from the ground.

The knife clattered to the ground. Sans quickly swiped it before Frisk could get any ideas, but the murderer's choked breaths and wide eyes told him that, at least for now, the fight was over.

He took a moment, closing his eyes to calm himself. Then, finally, he smirked and opened his eyes toward the impaled human. "rough mistake, huh," he taunted.

Frisk grunted. "...do it, fucker."

"hmmmmm..." Sans made a show of thinking about it. Then he shrugged. "nah, guess you'll just have to live."

Even as the human's breaths labored, he could sense their confusion. he wished he could feel smug as he slowly strolled up to them. "you think i'm stupid, kid? you think I don't know that every time this fight has finished, we go back and do this all over again? nah. see, i've been thinking about this. while we're in battle, you can't reset. and since you're gonna be ticking away HP for the next..." he mimed checking a wristwatch for the time. "...eternity, we're technically still battling."

"now, i'd love to *hang around*, but I have to go deal with the human friend who just fucked you over. don't worry, i'll come back. i'm sure you've got *a lot to get off your chest*."

Smirking, Sans turned away, waving sarcastically as he walked towards where he had seen the human girl in the hat.

As soon as he was no longer facing Frisk, his expression slid immediately into one of depression.

----

Climbing this path around a time rift was nothing she hadn't done before.

What Hat Kid was trying to figure out, however, was why one had materialised here. 

She could only guess it was to do with how Moonjumper and Alex had caused the barrier between universes to shatter, but... how had time coalesced into a rift here, so deep underground? 

She wondered if this place would give her answers to how to even start searching the multiverse for them. 

She shot her umbrella hook toward another grapple point, and swung across to another crystallized time block --

And then suddenly, a skeleton in a blue jacket was there waiting for her. 

Surprised, she landed oddly, having to do a few little hops to prevent falling on her face, or crashing into the monster that had appeared. She let out a small breath of relief. "Nailed it," she murmured to herself, before turning to the skeleton that was watching her with apprehension. "Umm, hi? How'd you get in here?"

The skeleton raised an eyebrow. "i should be asking the same thing, kiddo. just, waltzing in to the underground like you own the place."

She shook her head, as she swapped out her current hat for a Dweller's Mask. "Just here to fix these Time Rifts, then I'll be on my way. One sec." The mask's eyes lit up in green, and the girl vanished. 

Sans looked behind him. There was a block of green floating between this and the next block of solid ground. One that didn't seem to be quite a tangible part of this dimension.

Sure enough, the human popped into existence midway through jumping off the far end of the block, to the next platform. 

"i don't think you understand me, kid," said the skeleton as he was suddenly right beside Hat Kid again, causing her to flinch. "your other friend killed a lot of *my* friends. the underground does not. belong. to you."

Hat Kid paused, her jaw opening, silent briefly. "...Mu did *what*."

"...who?" Sans raised a non-existent eyebrow.

Hat Kid watched him for a moment, thinking. Then she snapped her fingers. "Oh, no, the one you were going to town on isn't with me. Mu's my space travelling partner. We're trying to find a way to fix the multiverse. And we encountered this rift's signature and we Tempus travellers have an obligation to fix them when we encounter them."

He stared blankly at her. "... you got some imagination, kiddo." Sans paused, and looked around him at the space around him.

The world which contained this 'time rift' felt very... abstract. As opposed to the confines and constant walls of the Underground, the reality around this tower of crystallized blocks was almost endless, a gently warping, shimmering space, almost as if this space were underwater. Up above them, far above, was a translucent plane that undulated and moved slowly, the light passing through from... something, casting its rays and shadows on everything. And off in the distance, he could see some massive creature just... casually floating about in this realm - not hostile, but perhaps not friendly. Just... there.

This wasn't always here, hidden behind the pillars of the Judgement Hall, was it?

Turning back to the human kid, he found that she had, again, moved ahead. He caught a glimpse of her near the top, floating back down to him with an open umbrella in one hand, and a glowing hourglass clutched to her chest with the other.

...heh. time rifts. hourglasses. 'tempus' traveller.

The kid landed next to Sans, pulled the umbrella shut and hooked it into her belt, and reached out to him with her now-freed hand. "Here, hold on to me," she said simply.

"...uhhh." Man, this girl was weird. "what's your deal, kid? ain't you scared of monsters like me?"

She shook her head. "I've befriended scarier. Seriously though. I don't know how you got in, but I don't want to accidentally leave you stuck here." 

Sans looked down at the outstretched hand, his own fingers fidgeting. He hadn't wanted to return them to his pockets *just in case*. He closed his eyes for a moment, thinking, then slowly he placed his bony hand in the kid's. "that happen often?" he asked her, tilting his head questioningly.

The kid looked at him pointedly. "You're the first non-Tempus I've seen able to perceive these at all, much less get in. Perhaps the same rules don't apply in this universe, though..."

As she focused, the hourglass's glow seemed to grow brighter, so bright Sans had to close his eyes.

"*Like with Alex...*" he heard the kid say.

Then suddenly they were both falling and his eyes shot open - only to find himself landing back on the tiled floor of the Judgement Hall.

If he could have let out a breath of relief...

Instead, he gestured the kid to follow him out onto the carpet, and pointed out the other human who was still impaled, still breathing (shakily, Sans noticed). "what about him then, kid?"

The kid cringed at the display of the clearly dying person, but her eyes turned back to him. "Is this the one that killed-"

"yeah," Sans cut her off. "...yeah, he did. but he's human, right? that's all that matters?"

She shook her head immediately. "First off, I'm pretty much an alien, not human. Second, if he's a killer, I don't care what he is, he can burn in hell."

This kid's immediate damning of Frisk was surprising to Sans, but it brought with it a certain amount of relief, a lightening of the weight he was carrying. *This one seemed okay. He could relax.*

Well, as much as he could relax, with the reality he now faced. "heh. y'know, I said the same thing to him earlier."

"That guy did WHAT?!" came a second girl's shouts from behind them.

Sans turned again.

The hatted kid's friend wore a red hooded cloak, long blonde hair and an *impressive* moustache for a child. He could immediately tell that this one wore her emotions on her sleeve more than her friend did. "We *have* to stop them!" she declared. 

"already taken care of," Sans said casually. "and you two are...?"

"Oh!" The purple-garbed kid hopped in place. "You can call me Hat Kid! This is Mustache Girl, my cohort."

The snort that erupted from Sans had the girls share an awkward look. "man, if things had been different... i would've loved for you to meet *monster kid*," he explained with a chuckle. "name's sans."

Mu raised an eyebrow, then turned to Hat Kid. "I couldn't find the source of that time fluctuation out there." She gestured past the doors that Frisk had strolled in through, whilst pulling a device from the hoodie pocket. "The fluctuations seemed to stop once we got down here--"

She was cut off by the device emitting a scratching noise, like a Geiger Counter. It had been pointing in the direction of Sans and Frisk. 

Sans watched warily as Mu stepped back and scanned the room with the device, hearing it come to life as it pointed at him, and with a more pronounced effect at Frisk. "What in the..." was all Mustache Girl said.

Hat Kid gave him a look. 

Sans eyed her back. "...time fluctuations, huh? what kind?"

"...whatever's been happening in this universe," Hat Kid explained slowly, "time keeps jumping back to about a few minutes ago. Weird that it hasn't done it again yet..."

"ah. yeah." The skeleton nodded back at the perpetrator behind him. "that's him RESETting."

"Resetting...?" Mu gave him a weird look. "What, like a video game? Don't you just mean he's time travelling?"

"yes and no..." Sans looked about awkwardly. It felt weird to be talking about this with someone, more so to a ~~human~~ humanoid alien thing. "look, uh... i'm not sure it matters now anyway. either he'll die and we'll fight again, or he'll lose his determination before then and... everyone else will still be dead. fuck, man," he mouthed.

"Everyone...?" Hat Kid's eyes were wide.

"the entire monster race," Sans nodded solemnly, and the girls noticed his eyes, or pupils or whatever had disappeared, leaving a blank stare. It was... kind of unnerving. "ever since the war however many... thousand years ago. this underground system has been our home. we're all however many generations removed from it..."

"b u t  w e  n e v e r  f o r g o t."

He turned, eyelights still out, so that he faced the door outside. "evidently the humans didn't, either. i've never in my life seen a kid with so much fear, so much hate. and now? thanks to him, it's just... me. me and asgore."

He turned again, slowly pacing toward what was left of Frisk. The girls nervously followed. "y'know, it's funny. all this resetting. all this going back to stop himself from dying. this... determination, to kill us. and it never occurred to him to go back further. before he came down here, before whatever happened that set him on this path."

He sighed, and Hat Kid wondered how he did that. He appeared to remove something from his hoodie, and she wondered what he had-

And then casually, Sans slid Frisk's knife through his temple. Hattie let out a shocked gasp, while Mu simply uttered a "whoa".

"if this has to be how the monster race ends, with me locked in battle with this... devil child. then so be it. he'll be resetting in a moment, i imagine."

Sans finally turned toward Hat Kid and Mu, and his pupils were back. He looked tired. "been nice to meet some humanoids who *didn't* want us dead, at least. so, thanks. wish I could enjoy it."

"...It's... been nice to meet you, Sans," Hat Kid nodded slowly. "I'm sorry that this has happened."

"Yeah, I'm glad someone's got this bad guy under control." Mu reached out for a fist-bump.

Sans looked at it for a moment, then relented, tapping his knuckles against hers. "heh. thanks, kiddos. i appreciate the support. really."

There was a pause.

"i'm kinda surprised it hasn't happened yet, actually." He slowly faced Frisk's body, retracting the bone pillar that had held him up. The corpse collapsed to the ground. "he would've been right back onto me by now."

"...Has he... given up?" Mu raised an eyebrow.

"perhaps." The skeleton made a thinking noise. "well, i should probably go ahead and tell the king the, uh, 'news'. and then... man, i dunno."

"Why don't you come with us?" Hat Kid said suddenly. Mu's features flashed in surprise, as if it were unexpected. "You don't have to be stuck down here. We could... use some help. There's a being called Moonjumper that's on the loose in the multiverse, tearing holes in realities. We're trying to put together something to track them down and hopefully restore everything back to how it was, and your... magic, is it? Would be useful in not just helping us, but helping the people and creatures of the multiverse that are affected."

Sans stood silently for a few moments. He glanced at Hat Kid's face, saw that she was serious, and hesitated before Checking her and her friend.

```
* Haley Komett - LVL 2 HP 4/4
* Her problems started the day she passed that planet.
* What she would give to go back to drawing faces on potatoes.

* Mu - LVL 1 HP 4/4
* She still doesn't quite understand how she's here alongside her.
* Judge, jury, executioner in one timeline, space/time adventurer in the next.
```

"...i dunno, kid. sounds like a fun time, but... do you really want a sad old bag of bones like me?" He eyed Mu carefully.

"She's befriended flamboyant birds, a robot vacuum, an evil lawyer spirit and his puppets, and a bunch of seals," Mu rattled off. "Buddy? You're child's play for her."
