Lily.

The Conductor.

In the darkness.

Him, with one of his shiniest steak knives aimed at her neck

Her, with one of her dualies raised and pointed at his skull.

A tense stand-off between two characters.

"Hooold still, lass," he said in a quiet voice, fixing a dark gaze on her. "This'll only take a moment."

"We'll see who's left standing by the end of this," she told him, with a smirk.

Neither of them dared to move.

Then:

A bright flash of light as the cameras around the two went off, blinding Lily. "I think we got it, boss!" One of the owl crew called, and Lily sighed in relief, dropping her arm.

"Good work, crew," the Conductor said in a chipper voice as the lights of the studio came back on, dropping the prior mood he had put on for the poster shoot. "Let's have a looksie then, eh?"
