Madeline looked about herself at the sullen monsters around the bonfire. The battle, the loss of friends and family, and the revelation of that 'Moonjumper' monster (and whatever 'Chara' was) had done much to drive some to despair.

She pulled the straps of her hoodie tighter, partially hiding her face. She had done her best with Theo to get as many of the monsters as she could to safety, but...

She wasn't able to get everyone.

Her head sank, as her mind spiralled down, barely registering the sound of armor jostling in her direction.

"Hey, punk."

Maddy looked up behind her at Undyne. The monster warrior was taking it rough as well - having lost a few of her Guard - but was still managing to keep watch over the survivors.

The monster continued, "I... Look, thanks for helping us get everyone to safety, human."

Maddy winced. "I'm... sorry it wasn't everyone."

Undyne sighed, and crouched down, her head level with the human's. "You saw what that... *thing* was capable of. Most people- most *monsters* would see what you saw and run away. But you - you and those kids - you pushed through and you did your damnedest to get people you didn't know existed to safety." She smiled, exposing her teeth. "You've got guts, human. Even if you don't know ya do."

"Madeline. It's Madeline. Or... Maddy if you prefer."

"Heh. Undyne, Captain of the Royal Guard." She stuck her armored hand out, and Maddy took it in hers and shook. "But I guess you figured that out, huh. So how'd a punk like you managed to blow a new hole in the mountain?"

Maddy's brows furrowed, and she turned herself fully to face the monster. "Huh?"

"When you fell down here. That hole up there?" Undyne pointed up into the distance, and Madeline could see wisps of snow, moonlight, filter through a hole in the cavernous roof. "That's all you."

"Oh. Well, um... technically that wasn't me, that was only *Part of Me*."

"The hell does *that* mean?"

"...Hey." A familiar voice startled them both, from behind Maddy. She watched the monster's eye go wide, focusing on someone behind her, then darting back and forth between Maddy and the stranger.

Maddy wasn't ready to see her again yet. But she still let out a soft chuckle at what it must look like to Undyne - an apparent clone just appearing from nowhere. She turned to face the Part of Her. "Look, I... I fucked up. I thought that-"

"Shut it." Despite the harsh words, Part of Maddy didn't appear to be angry. She spoke both to Maddy and Undyne, "There's something you need to know. I... get that it feels the same, but *this* mountain, and the one we came from, are not the same."

"...What does *that* mean," both responded simultaneously.

"I don't know yet, okay?!" Part of Her snapped, rising into the air. "Just-- the surface of Mount Celeste up there, I *feel* the magic or whatever coursing through me. Down here... Something's not right. There's magic, sure, but it's... different. Nothing *feels* right. Whatever made that Mirror Temple, whatever keeps that idiot Oshiro's ghost alive up there... it's not *down here*."

Undyne focused her gaze on the levitating human. "For one, it's Mount Ebott. For two-"

"Mount Ebott isn't *real*," Part of Maddy spat. "There's no mountain on Earth named that."

"Well what do you think *this* all is?!" Undyne shouted, causing some of the monsters and humans around them to flinch and turn toward them.

Suddenly a mug of hot chocolate appeared in front of Maddy's vision, and she flinched back - but not before Theo caught her with his free hand and helped her upright. "You're *both* correct."

"The hell do you mean?" Undyne raised an eyebrow up at him.

He took a seat next to Maddy. "Well, ya see..."
