Madeline looked about herself at the sullen monsters around the bonfire. The battle, the loss of friends and family, and the revelation of that 'Moonjumper' monster (and whatever 'Chara' was) had done much to drive some to despair.

She pulled the straps of her hoodie tighter, partially hiding her face. She had done her best with Theo to get as many of the monsters as she could to safety, but...

She wasn't able to get everyone.

Her head sank, as her mind spiralled down, barely registering the sound of armor jostling in her direction.

"Hey, punk."

Maddy looked up behind her at Undyne. The monster warrior was taking it rough as well - having lost a few of her Guard. Her eyesockets were dim, and she looked haunted by what she had seen... but was still managing to keep watch over the survivors.

The monster continued, "I... Look, thanks for helping us get everyone to safety, human."

Maddy winced. "I'm... sorry it wasn't everyone."

Undyne sighed, and crouched down, her head level with the human's. "Don't be. You saw what that... *thing* was capable of. Most people- most *monsters* would see what you saw and run away. But you - you and those kids - you pushed through and you did your damnedest to get people you didn't know existed to safety." She smiled, exposing her teeth. "You've got guts, human. Even if you don't know ya do."

"Madeline. It's Madeline. Or... Maddy if you prefer."

"Heh. Undyne, Captain of the Royal Guard." She stuck her armored hand out, and Maddy took it in hers and shook. "But I guess you figured that out, huh. So how'd a punk like you managed to blow a new hole in the mountain?"

Maddy's brows furrowed, and she turned herself fully to face the monster. "Huh?"

"When you fell down here. That hole up there?" Undyne pointed up into the distance, and Madeline could see wisps of snow, moonlight, filter through a hole in the cavernous roof. "That's all you."

"Oh. Well, um... technically that wasn't me, that was only *Part of Me*."

"The hell does *that* mean?"

"...Hey." A familiar voice startled them both, from behind Maddy. She watched the monster's eye go wide, focusing on someone behind her, then darting back and forth between Maddy and the stranger.

Maddy wasn't ready to see her again yet. But she still let out a soft chuckle at what it must look like to Undyne - an apparent clone just appearing from nowhere. She turned to face the Part of Her. "Look, I... I fucked up. I thought that-"

"Shut it." Despite the harsh words, Part of Maddy didn't appear to be angry. She spoke both to Maddy and Undyne, "There's something you need to know. I... get that it feels the same, but *this* mountain, and the one we came from, are not the same."

"...What does *that* mean," both responded simultaneously.

"I don't know yet, okay?!" Part of Her snapped, rising into the air. "Just-- the surface of Mount Celeste up there, I *feel* the magic or whatever coursing through me. Down here... Something's not right. There's magic, sure, but it's... different. Nothing *feels* right. Whatever made that Mirror Temple, whatever keeps that idiot Oshiro's ghost alive up there... it's not *down here*."

Undyne focused her gaze on the levitating human. "For one, it's Mount Ebott. For two-"

"Mount Ebott isn't *real*," Part of Maddy spat. "Miss Mountain Climber over here did her research before coming out here. There's no mountain on Earth named Ebott."

"Well what do you think *this* all is?!" Undyne shouted, causing some of the monsters and humans around them to flinch and turn toward them.

Suddenly a mug of hot chocolate appeared in front of Maddy's vision, and she flinched back - but not before Theo caught her with his free hand and helped her upright. "You're *both* correct."

"The hell do *you* mean?" Undyne raised an eyebrow up at him.

Theo took a seat next to Maddy. His expression seemed slightly vacant as well, haunted by what was quickly becoming the longest day of his life. "Those kids running around? The girl with the hat, and the one with the hood and the frankly impressive moustache say they're from another universe."

"They're *kids*," Part of Maddy sighed out, annoyed. "They're making it up."

"I don't know that they are. Okay, fine, I don't know all the complicated science terms, but they seemed to know what they're talking about." He leaned in. "They reckon worlds are blending together or something. I'm inclined to believe 'em. I think us three," he gestured between himself, Maddy and her doppleganger, "*started* on Mount Celeste, and then somewhere along the way, we ended up on, or *in* Mount Ebott. I mean, c'mon, magical beings? Monsters? That wouldn't exist on *our* Earth."

Part of Maddy, in response, simply gestured at her floating self. Undyne raised an eyebrow again.

"... okay, fair." Theo chuckled. "Personally, I think the magic here is different from whatever weird mountain magic we had going on above. And boy, that... I think they called it Moonjumper? He felt like something else entirely."

"Mountain magic...?" Undyne murmured. "Nah, that can't be us. That Barrier keeps us all down here, magic and all. And if y'all are *climbing* the mountain, there's no way you could have entered our influence before now."

"So that... Mirror Temple..." Maddy gulped, fearful at the mere thought of the place. "With the creepiness and the demonic things that are apparently manifestations of my self doubts and the *giant fucking eyeball*... that's not...?"

"Most certainly not." One of the larger guard dogs, having been overhearing the conversation, turned toward them. "To put it simply, us monsters are made of love and compassion. I don't know of any monster capable of what you're describing, dear."

"Why do y'all call yourselves monsters anyway?" Theo noted. "You've gotta have a better outlook on yourselves! You can't be a monster if you explicitly *care* for people!"

"Hm. That might be a dialectical difference." Dogaressa chuckled.

"We've always used the term 'monster' to refer to us as a whole, dude," Undyne added. "Sure, we're all sorts, but we're all magic and dust and shit, it's just the name that stuck for us." She shrugged. "I can understand where those kids are coming from though. I mean, sure humans drop in now and then... heh... But there's not been anything quite on this level though! It honestly has me a little worried for the future. I mean, what if *more* assholes like that turn up?!"
