"there's just... one more thing that i'd like to discuss, then," Sans said, his tone shifting, indicating this was going to be somewhat uncomfortable. "before we decide on whether or not to stay."

"Sure," Hat Kid nodded, sitting up.

"i need to discuss your LV," he says bluntly. "both of you." Toriel let out a soft 'oh', and Frisk gasped, realising he was going to pass judgment on them - as they had done with them prior.

"LV...?" Mu cocked her head.

"it's a monster term," Sans explained. "it stands for 'level of violence'." He took a breath, and leaned in toward the two kids. "most humans and monsters are gonna have an LV of 1. that's great. LV 2 can happen as an accident, sometimes. but when i met you both, before frisk reset, there was something when I checked you then that concerned me. so, i'm going to run that check again. okay? i'll be totally transparent with it, since you've been fairly helpful so far. but i need you to help me understand it. are you ready?"

Mu and Hattie shared a look. "I... guess?" Hat Kid raised an eyebrow? "What does this 'check' invol--"

She stopped in her tracks the moment she felt her sins crawling on her back. Felt the weight of every decision she had ever made in one instant.

Between her and Sans, the skeleton raised a palm, and a... text box appeared, floating above it.

```
* Haley Komett - LV 4 HP 4/4
* Her problems started the day she passed that planet.
* What she would give to go back to drawing faces on potatoes.
```

Hat Kid stared at the floating box, a fear on the edges of her expression. "...But... I don't understand. ...How can I have an LV, if I've haven't *done* anything violent in your universe?"

Sans took a deep breath, his eyesockets shutting. "doesn't matter, kid. there's only one way you gain LV."

"...And how's that?" she quietly asked him.

Frisk's sharp intake of breath earned them the attention of the other two kids. "...You've killed," they said, softly, tears in their eyes.

Mu and Hattie shared a look of horror. "...You've... killed, Hattie?"

"Have I?" Hat Kid stared at the text box, wracking her brain.

"I always took you for a goody-two-shoes, really," Mu said quietly, also staring at the text box.

"i can see that," Sans nodded. "but whether or not it was intentional, you've killed all the same. perhaps you're not a chara, but, that LV is not a mistake. you don't get that with a normal amount of killing."

Mu was slightly skeptical. "There's... a normal amount of killing?" 

Sans, despite the serious subject, allowed a soft chuckle. "zero, ideally." He turned to Mustache Girl. "heads up."

```
* Mu - LV 1 HP 4/4
* She still doesn't quite understand how she's here alongside her.
* Judge, jury, executioner in one timeline, space/time adventurer in the next.
```

Mu gasped, the sudden weight of all her sins weighing her down in her chair. Suddenly she was reliving Time's End, the fight against the Mafia Boss, her subsequent liquefication of his body, all the world's inhabitants she sent to their fate...

The inhabitants of the planet, coming together to tell her to '*get lost*'.

She felt herself choking on her emotions, the hate, the fear, the horrible things she'd done. She was shocked into silence.

"...hm, okay. now i understand," Sans mused. "your LV is 1 because all that got undone, huh? but you still made those decisions. people still died."

He allowed them a moment to catch their breath. "now, my role as judge is more meant for the underground. y'know, determining who should be allowed to see asgore n' such. but if we ride with you on this adventure, we *need to know* that our trust in you won't lead to our deaths.

"so, i ask one simple thing." Sans leaned back. "explain these deaths."

The first thing Mu said, looking toward her companion, was, "The Mafia Boss."

HK thought a moment, then gasped. "You're right... I remembered that going like any other battle I've had, just trying to knock 'em out or get them to stand down. But..." She choked slightly, taking a deep breath, then turned her attention to Sans. "Okay. One moment, I need a prop to explain the 'why'." She stood from the dining table, turned, shivered lightly, then pushed her way through the doors.

A moment later, after a moment of hearing something large unlock, open, and shut again, she returned, holding what was clearly a magical hourglass. Rather, it floated above her outstretched hand.

Hat Kid placed it down on the table, and Toriel, Sans, Frisk and Cooking Cat watched it gently pulse, some sort of... mystical energy inside. "This is a Time Piece," she began. "It is a powerful energy source, harvested from exoplanets and other stars in the process of imploding, becoming... a black hole, a point in space so dense that even *time* cannot escape. It is... the primary energy source for the Tempus civilization."

"It's... beautiful," Toriel said quietly.

Hat Kid nodded. "That energy potential is renewable... but dangerous." She picked it up again, looking at it in her hands, looking around the dirtied kitchen... before casually tossing it behind her, hearing it smash open on the tiled floor, even as Sans and Frisk's eyes both widened in shock.

The resulting burst of energy was so bright that everyone else had to shield their eyes, and then--

The group all found themselves back in their positions from a few minutes ago, with Toriel putting the dishes away with Sans, and Frisk and Mu in the middle of their chase game. The four stuttered to a halt, turning to look at each other. 

"...dangerous because it can reset time," Sans says, a hint of understanding in his expression as everybody took their seats again.

Hattie nodded, and picked up the suddenly-undamaged Time Piece back up off the ground, where it had landed, and set it back on the table, this time keeping her hand on it. "My ship was attacked, some time back. It caused these Time Pieces to scatter across a nearby planet. Us Tempians are resistant to its pull, but to those unused to working with them... The allure of using that power to undo mistakes, or change things is... very difficult to ignore."

She took a moment to glance at all those seated. "I think rather than me explaining... I should show you." She tapped her hand on the Time Piece, gesturing to also touch the magical hourglass. As the monsters reached to gently rest their digits or paws on the thing, and Frisk stood to reach over to it, Mu was hesitant. After a gentle reassurance of "it's okay" from Hat Kid, she also rested her hand atop the hourglass.

"This might be a bit disorienting," Hat Kid warned, before closing her eyes and thinking back.

Time seemed to slow, and a rush of scenes appeared before the group's eyes.
