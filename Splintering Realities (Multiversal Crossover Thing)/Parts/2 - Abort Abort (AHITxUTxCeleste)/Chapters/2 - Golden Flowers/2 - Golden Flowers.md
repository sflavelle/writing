## Golden Flowers

Mu was the first to wake, owing to her life as a light sleeper, what with the Mafia and all that.

And as soon as she couldn't place where she woke up, she was scrambling to her feet to get a look around.

She did not want anyone getting the jump on her again.

Her emerging panic at being alone again halted as soon as she noticed Hat Kid nearby.

Her eyebrow raised as she then saw the other kid - the one that that skeleton, Sans, had killed - slowly coming to, in the same bed of flowers as she and Hattie.

A bed of golden flowers, to be exact.

This bed was brightly lit amidst the sea of darkness - Mu looked upward, and found its light source somewhere up above, a hole in the rocky walls surrounding them.

Okay, so they were still underground...

She turned around, to this 'Frisk' character, who was now sat up, rubbing their head and breathing hard. They were facing away, quickly curling into themselves.

Did they know they brought her and Hattie here...?

----

Why?

Why had they ended up back here? 

Were they being tested?

Was this punishment?

... Could things have gone differently?

Frisk looked back over their journey so far. 

... it started with Toriel. A genuine accident.

Their trek through the Ruins with her had already shown that monsters could be peaceful. 

It had been a Froggit that had given the advice that would ultimately condemn Frisk to their unfortunate role. "(Ribbit)," it had said, it's words paraphrased in Frisk's mind. "There are two ways to spare someone. Through making them happy, or by weakening them until they no longer wish to fight you."

And when, during that fateful encounter, Toriel had refused to engage them in any sort of conversation, some way of disarming this situation...

...Well, they thought they were doing the right thing by doing what Toriel had asked, following the Froggit's advice. They thought, at some point, she would call a halt to the battle. That she would be convinced that Frisk could hold their own. That they would be allowed to pass on their way, to hurry their way through the Underground and find an exit, a way back home. 

They never wanted to kill her. 

But...

...that was what happened.

...

The monsters outside of the ruins were scarier. 

Frisk fled when they could, away from the Death-looking deer and the dogs with axes.

Poor Papyrus. They had liked him, when he wasn't trying to capture them for their soul. He was funny!

But when the attacks started, Frisk had had to resort to self defence.

Because being captured would mean being killed. And Frisk didn't want to die.

A tear slid from their cheek onto a flower beneath them.

Honestly, Frisk had hoped that Toriel was a fluke. That surely this goof knew when to stop. He would probably say something like, 'WOWIE! YOUR PROWESS IN BATTLE IS IMPRESSIVE FOR A YOUNG CHILD, THOUGH NOT QUITE AS IMPRESSIVE AS MYSELF. I'VE HAD SUCH FUN WITH OUR PUZZLES, WHY DON'T WE ABANDON THIS FIGHT AND GO DO SOME MORE OF THAT!'

That wasn't what he said, in the end. 

In the end, it was all turning out as the flower said. 

"Kill or be killed."

A choked sob escaped them.

Stupid... what was their name. Flowey. Stupid Chara. Stupid Underground. 

In the end, due to their actions, Frisk was stuck believing that they *had* to kill, to escape. Chara had wormed their way in to them, a presence that had soon presented itself to be malevolent. 

By the time their sins had caught up to them, they were no longer in control of their actions. They had become a prisoner in their own body. 

And then... that girl showed up. The one whose power had gotten them killed. 

And seeing, through dimming eyes, the way that Sans had interacted with them, hesitant but hopeful ...

The way Sans, after *everything* they had done to him and his friends, still hoped that humans and monsters could coexist...

Frisk could say that was the moment their determination broke, bleeding away much as their HP was.

They didn't want to do this anymore.

They were wrong. 

Frisk could die knowing that they couldn't hurt the monsters anymore. That Chara's soul and Flowey's words could no longer guide their hand.

So then, what was this? Had they somehow LOADed in their last moments? Was everything truly back to how it had been before their journey began? 

How could they ever face any of them again? 

Frisk sobbed freely into their knees, believing themselves alone at the moment. 

Not noticing the boss monster's head that pulled away out of view, having poked her head out from behind the arch.

----

Toriel was conflicted.

On the one hand, she knew, somehow, that the human child in the pile of flowers had killed her, once.

On the other... she remembered that they had very clearly tried to get her to stop during their fight.

But *she* had fallen... to a human *child*.

And now there were *three* here.

And how did she *remember*?

...What was happening here?

She paced along the room, arms crossed behind her back, thinking.

If what she had experienced was a memory, then these other two children should not be here. They were an unknown variable.

If what she had experienced was deja vu, however... it was much, much too vivid to be simply that. 

...Something strange was going on here.

"You're talking to yourself."

Toriel spun in place.

A flower watched her from the lit patch of dirt,  head tilted questioningly.

Flowey.

"Oh, goodness me," Toriel sighed, rubbing at where her soul pulsed in her chest. "I did not realise. I..." 

Her eyes widened as she realised that she had been speaking her confusions aloud. "Oh! I. Erm. Do not mind me. This old goat has been having bad dreams."

Flowey watched her with a look that clearly conveyed that he - it - did not believe her. Its expression shifted to one of *knowing*. "...Okay then." It turned toward the doorway. "I only heard one of them fall. I didn't expect three."

"Three is... unusual," Toriel agreed. She was beginning to remember a bit more about this flower - she had stopped them... last time... from killing the one that was named Frisk.

The one who was now crying in the bed of flowers.

Why was it acting so normal now?

Toriel kept her thoughts to herself this time, and continued, steeling herself. "I shall greet them. It is only fair."

"Are you sure?" Flowey asked as the boss monster began to walk toward the first room, toward the bed of flowers. "I'm getting some bad vibes from them."

Toriel pointedly decided not to reply, but then...

The ground beneath began to shake. Was this... an earthquake? But those didn't happen anywhere near Mount Ebott!

Still.

"Get to shelter," she said firmly to Flowey, as screams came from the flower bed. "They will not die here."

And she hurried out of the room, prepared to protect the human children from danger.

----

"SANS!! YOU'RE NOT AT YOUR STATION!"

"oh, dang, i'm not? i always thought i was rather *stationary*."

"DO NOT TARNISH THIS MORNING WITH YOUR PUNS, BROTHER, HOWEVER TRUE THIS ONE IS. THAT SAID, SINCE YOU ARE HERE, YOU MAY AS WELL SHARE IN THIS BREAKFAST I'VE MADE."

"you're so cool, bro."

"YES, I KNOW."

So things had RESET. Sans hadnt had this happen in a while. He wondered if it was Frisk's doing, or whether that... *weed* had.

Well, either way, he would not let them have their way this time. This time, he would stop them before--

The ground began to shake, throwing him off balance briefly. A tremor...? But this never happened... "whoa. what the."

Breakfast quickly forgotten, the skeletons braced themselves, under the kitchen table. "ANY DEBRIS FROM THESE EARTHQUAKE TREMORS WON'T REACH US HERE!" Papyrus declared. "I DO HOPE THE CITIZENS OF SNOWDIN ALSO RECEIVED THESE NATURAL DISASTER GUIDES AND ARE STAYING SAFE."

"i'm sure they're doing fine, paps. i thought tremors didn't hit this area."

"I THOUGHT THE SAME! WHAT AN ODD DEVELOPMENT!"

----

With everyone sheltering in their homes underground, only a select few saw the object that broke through the ceiling above Waterfall, its impact showering rocks over the area. 

The source: one human girl's body, red-haired, blue-jacketed, half unconscious as she plummeted into the waters. 

The cold water shocked her awake, and looking around herself, the redhead swam hard for the light, breaking the surface of the turbulent water and gripping a rocky ledge for dear life. 

Slowly, she forced herself to climb up from the water, soaking wet, and sprawled on the damp, bioluminescent grass beneath her. 

Staring up in the hole in the massive cavernous roof.

Madeline Thorson had failed to best Mount Celeste. 

And now it seemed she would be stuck down here for the rest of her days.

Which, if the armored knight already stalking toward her rough location had anything to say about it, would not be very long.

----

Only the Royal Scientist Dr. Alphys, in her lab in Hotland, could see the tremor for what it was.

As she hunkered down beneath a fixed table, she watched as sensors on her machines picked up large bursts of energy, not just physical but... magical, as well?

It was an energy pulse, travelling across the planet from... somewhere, leaving these tremors in its wake.

Screens depicted Mount Ebott above being hit particularly hard, and she hoped beyond hope that everyone beneath would be okay.

Other sensors detected rockfalls in various areas due to the activity, and one of the cameras--

One of her security cameras, placed looking over the Waterfall area, caught something crashing into the waters - a *body* - followed by more rockfall.

And... wisps of... snow?

Breathing heavily, still weathering through the rough quaking herself, Alphys snatched a remote from the table above her, retreated back to her safety spot, and directed the camera to look upward.

Indeed, through the hole in the cavern ceiling - exposing the *sky*, Alphys realised - it... appeared to be snowing.

Alphys frowned. But Mount Ebott *never* snowed.

Something *weird* was going on.
