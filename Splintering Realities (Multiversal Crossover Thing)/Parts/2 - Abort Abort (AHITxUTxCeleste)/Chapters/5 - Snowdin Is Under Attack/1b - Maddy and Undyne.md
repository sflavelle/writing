At the other edge of town, Undyne had finally caught up to the redhead. With piercing magical energy, her attack finally connected and-

Though it passed through her harmlessly, Madeline find herself suddenly unable to move.

Breathing hard, she struggled to escape the pull off whatever was keeping her rooted in place, before a colourful glow stopped her, and she glanced down at herself...

And saw her soul, a gentle heart shaped object, floating before her. Not unlike the heart crystals she had seen on the mountain itself. 

She heard the monster approach from behind, casually now. No longer concerned with her quarry getting away. 

"Jeez human... you've got legs!" Undyne praised, a sharp grin on her face as she walked into the other's field of vision. "BUT! Running away won't help you..." Another magical spear fizzled to life in her hands. "You've got to face your problems HEAD ON--"

A large booming explosion behind her cut her off, and she whirled around. "The fuck?!"

Both Undyne and Maddy watched as a large plume of fire and smoke poured into the air, from what seemed like a diner partway into town. Debris and hot oil was flung outward and upward, littering the ground around it...

But then they glanced further into Snowdin, and the true extent of the problem made itself known. 

Two creatures - a floating masked being and a sinister looking red... cloud - wreaking havoc in the town. As the former delighted in setting the buildings alight with its magic and wrapping its strings around the monsters trying to attack it, the cloud would converge upon a monster, screams and dark laughter, and within seconds, the cloud would move on...

Leaving nothing but dust. 

These two creatures were slaughtering monsters-

Undyne was grabbed by the collar of her armour and yanked backward, stumbling. "Oh that is LOW-"

The thud of heavy wood from the diner slamming into the ground where she had just been a second ago was enough to shut her up. 

Undyne stared at the thing that had nearly taken her out, then turned to the human that had pulled her from harm's way, soul still tinted green. With a wave of her spear, Maddy's soul flickered back to its normal colour, and she felt lighter again, able to unplant her feet. "...D-don't think this means anything! Just because we're under attack-"

"Let me help you."

"Wh- You??" Undyne barked out a laugh, a hint of despair in her voice. "How in the HELL are you gonna face THAT?!"

"I'm not." Maddy eyed the monster, forcing herself forward to a wall out of sight. The monster joined her. "I'm going to get whoever's trapped in those buildings out of there."

"And out where those guys can dust 'em?! GREAT plan, human!"

"Would you rather we just let them burn?!" Madeline snapped. "At least with whoever's attacking them back, they'll be distracted enough for us to get people to safety! Who's defending, anyways?"

Undyne sneaked a look past the wall. "That's the local Royal Guard unit! Hell yeah! Okay, look, I'm Captain, so I'll get over there and help out, if you think you can get whoever's staying at the Inn?"

Maddy smirked. "You've seen my moves. I'll get them out in no time."

Undyne grinned, her sharp teeth *very* visible. "...okay, OKAY! A truce, then? I'll distract them while you get the civvies out?" She turned to Madeline and stuck out her gloved, webbed hands.

Maddy nodded. "Truce sounds good." She clasped the knight's hand in her own and shook.

"Excellent!" Before moving on, she reached beneath her armour and pulled a mobile phone from within her pants. "Just need to inform the capital of the attack, then we'll move on my mark, okay?"
