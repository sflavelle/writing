****

For the first time in many, many years, Toriel's home was filled with the joyous sounds of children playing and talking, as Frisk, Hat Kid and Mu got to know each other, Theo keeping an eye on them - Sans having volunteered him to do so while he and Toriel prepared a meal.

Not that the influencer minded - he needed the distraction from his thoughts and worries about Madeline.

He hoped she wasn't seriously hurt...

He couldn't believe Maddy was however old and didn't have any sort of mobile phone. How on earth did she get on without one? It would have been so nice to just, be able to call her and see if she was okay.

Unfortunately... well, she didn't. And they were both lost under the mountain in... what seemed like a brand new world.

His gaze shifted from his phone to the kitchen door.

Monsters.

Living just under the surface.

Creatures that were certifiably non-human, with magic, that had supposedly gone unnoticed by the surface world.

And yet, when descending here to find Maddy, she had run into these three kids.

He wondered what was going on down here...

"Would you pass the large pie tray, dear?"

"of course." The requested tray floated in front of Toriel's vision as she cut the dough into the desired shape for the base.

She took it, and glanced over at Sans, leaning against the bench she was working at.

Maybe she should tell him. As her good friend.

Maybe he could help her reconciliate the strange emotions floating around inside of her regarding Frisk, and these children, and just how *different* this was compared to... well, what had become the norm when someone fell into the Ruins.

Compared to when she had first met Frisk, *last time*.

She put the dough into the tray, then layered the cinnamon/butterscotch filling on top, but then paused before she started to cut the dough top.

She thought for a moment, then turned to him, taking a breath to speak-

"i'm not sure i like that kid frisk, tori."

Toriel blinked. She searched Sans' lazily grinning expression for some sort of indicator on his feelings, but she was quickly learning that her friend was *very* good at keeping his expression closed.

She glanced toward the kitchen door, making sure they weren't being eavesdropped on. Nobody was there. "How do you mean? I don't think they've done anything since falling into the Ruins..."

Sans was silent briefly as he determined how best to explain. "part of my job involves me needing to know if someone is coming to the king with ill intentions. and... the kid seems nice enough. but..."

"But they've killed." Toriel glanced away.

"yeah." Sans nodded, head low.

They stood in silence for a few seconds.

Then Sans' head shot up to look at her. "wait. huh?"

Toriel gulped silently, painfully, and looked toward him. "I'm... not entirely sure how, but... Something happened recently. This is the second time I have seen them here. The first..." she sighed heavily, and her shoulders slumped. "This is difficult to explain. But something tells me they feel a great remorse for whatever pain they have caused."

"do they, though?" Sans pushed. "or are they just waiting for the right moment to strike?"

"What does your SOUL tell you?" Toriel responded quickly
