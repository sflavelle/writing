Madeline was not taking the failure well.

As she waded through the bioluminescent marsh, she kept glancing up above her and seeing just how impossibly far away that hole in the ceiling was.

Part of Her was right. She'd not been able to climb the mountain.

And now for her hubris, she was trapped down here in this massive cavern, probably for the rest of her life.

All because she thought she could prove herself. Because she thought she *could* actually do what she set her mind to.

How *pathetic*. Why would she think that? Success was something that happened to other people.

Not to someone like *her*.

She entered into a passage, vaguely taking in the eroded statue, water dripping on it from a crack in the rock above, and what must have been its counterpart, a statue of an armored knight opposite. It stood with a glowing spear struck into the stony ground, instead of a sword like most statues that came to mind. The spear was the only source of light in this room.

Oh. She should have guessed even beneath the mountain hid some secrets. She honestly hadn't been paying attention, having been wallowing internally.

She ventured past the statues, glancing around for some way forward, noticing that through one archway was... a piano?

Confused, Maddy walked toward it.

As she entered the room, walking toward the piano, she saw that... it was indeed a grand piano. Just, any old piano like one she remembered once being in her grandparents' home.

Curiously she tested it, pressing a few keys. She raised an eyebrow. This thing was still *tuned*? Who even kept it in good condition?

Madeline allowed herself a moment to indulge in her melancholy. She took a seat at the piano, letting out a sigh, tested a few keys to find the chord she wanted, then began to play, a stripped down version of a tune she had heard playing back in the Abandoned City.

She closed her eyes. She fully believed that she would probably never find her way back to even the surface again.

Mom... Theo... she wouldn't see them again.

And she had destroyed any chance at reconciling with the Part of Her that antagonized her. She'd probably never see her again either.

Her fingers slowed, and stopped. Sighing out again, the heaviness in her chest weighing on her mind, she slowly opened her eyes, glancing around the room.

Besides the piano, there was a bin holding a number of umbrellas inside. And... nothing else. Wait, there was a statue outside this room that was getting rained on. Was... this a puzzle?

Probably. Well, that... fucking *temple* had a lot of puzzles, even, and that had been very recent, so part of her still felt wired to do such a thing. She approached the bin, picked up a umbrella-

"*Six.*"

Madeline whirled around.

The knight statue now blocked the doorway, spear in hand.

"*Six human souls, we've collected.*"

Maddy's eyes widened. *The statue was not a statue.* The knight's voice rang hollow through the suit of armor as it slowly stepped into the room.

"*We only need one more to destroy the Barrier, and we will be free.*"

The knight thrust its spear out, pointing it outstretched toward Madeline. Adrenaline flooded the human's body, and she began to think about her best chance of escape.

"*We have waited a thousand years for this moment!*"

The knight paused, and one of its hands went to its helmet, swiftly removing it in a grand gesture. And underneath...

Madeline's blood went cold.

*It was not human.*

Blue, scaly skin and golden eyes, red hair, sharp grinning teeth. An eyepatch.

"NOW!" The female creature's voice declared. "RELINQUISH YOUR SOUL!"

Madeline gulped, and slipped back into what was becoming quite common lately: jumping at the wall, using the wall to boost herself up higher, and - in a rush of motion the monster wasn't expecting - zooming up and over its head, hitting the ground in the direction of the doorway and rushing out of the door, looking for any kind of escape from the monster charging after her.

"THEO?! SOMEONE? ANYONE!" she screamed out, hoping that *anyone* might be able to come to her aid.

...

But no one came.
