The changes would keep coming. 

Toriel entered into the front 'yard' of her home, her guests following, only to pause at the sight of an unknown skeleton monster sitting on the steps. 

The sight of her caught his attention, and he stood quickly, shoving his hands in his pockets, looking a little awkward. "heya. i know you don't recognise me, but uh-"

"Oh! Hi Sans!" Hat Kid had peeked out from behind the goat monster, and waved at him.

Sans blinked, stunned that he was remembered. Though, he supposed, if someone would with these resets, it would be the time traveller. The goat monster which he could only assume was his unseen 'friend behind the door' looked surprised that the kid already knew. 

The rest of the group filtered in behind her, and the skeleton noticed that out of all of them, he wasn't expecting an adult human man who was clearly prepared for climbing a mountain. Be couldn't tell how Theo was processing the situation, but his eyes were wide and he was clearly shocked at the sight of Sans. He tried not to take it personally - children could more easily accept things like the existence of magical monsters, and adult humans, from what he'd seen of media that filtered in through the Dump, saw skeletons as reminders of their own mortality.

There - behind him, squabbling with the mustached girl - was the human he was looking for. It looked as if Frisk was trying to get behind Mu, to hide themselves, but she had seen through it and was trying to put them in front of her. Sans chuckled, and stepped closer. 

Toriel eyed him with confusion. "Your voice seems familiar. May I help you...?" She took a step to place herself between Sans and the humans.

He glanced up at her, seeing her unease. Her voice was very familiar to him - now he was certain that this was his friend. His grin grew more genuine, and he answered, "guess i was just feeling a little *bonely* today."

His grin widened as he saw Hat Kid giggle to herself, and moreso when Toriel's eyes widened in recognition, a delighted smile forming. "Well, we've *goat-a* catch up then, don't we?"

Hat Kid burst out laughing, and even Frisk, in spite of their clear fear of Sans, snorted with laughter. Sans eyed them. "sounds like a plan. i was actually hoping to chat to these little squirts you've found."

"Well then, why don't you join us for an afternoon meal? These children have quite the story to tell." Toriel's smile was warm, her expression inviting. She was excited to be able to put a face to the voice she had been talking to for so long.

"i would be delighted."
