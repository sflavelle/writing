"Susie."

"I'm gonna say it."

"I don't *know*, Susie."

"Nup, too late. Sayin' it."

"*Please*. Ralsei couldn't have just disappeared into thin air."

"Where."

Kris let out a deep sigh, resigned to hearing their companion's complaint.

"The fuck."

Susie's face was contorted in a manic grin.

"Are we."

Slowly, Kris raised their head, fixing Susie with a dead stare. They were silent for a few long moments.

Finally, they took a breath. "Was that worth it?"

"Very."

"Great. Please help me check this weird-ass office."
