And then, as Ralsei began to wonder if the Void would swallow them whole-

There was a flash of white, and a burst of sound, and suddenly the three monsters found themselves stood in the middle of a platform, barriers spinning wildly around them. Subconsciously the three pressed against each other, not eager to be hit by such high-speed objects.

The room was darkened, the only light being the cloudy sunlight from the window opposite the group. The machine made mechanical noises and a 'spinning down' kind of sound as the barriers slowed, and the platform holding them began to lower them to the ground - but apart from the machine dropping into this failsafe state, nothing else in the room was powered it would seem.

The platform clunked mechanically against the base of the machine, pressing into the floor, and the barriers settled into place at the back. The gate opened, finally allowing the monsters out, and all three of Ralsei, Rouxls Kaard, and Jevil gladly did so. "Is everyone okay?" Ralsei asked, catching their breath.

"Thankethfully," commented Rouxls, who was currently bent over, taking deep breaths and focusing their vision on the floor.

"Ueeheehee!" cried Jevil joyfully. "That was fun, fun! What freedom is this?"

Ralsei opened his mouth to respond and correct the jester, but the prince was interrupted by the sound of flickering lights and machines coming to life as the power returned to the room, temporarily knocked out by the transmission. An entire wall of machines to the right of the three monsters blinked to life, tiny lights bursting into color - some red, some green; some that flickered, some that didn't. Multiple screens blinked to life, computers booting up. The three also took proper notice now of the raised catwalk on the window side of the room, filled with what looked like another such computer, integrated into a desk or... something.

Finally, to their left was a doorway, currently closed with a massive metal panel. Jevil gave it a curious push, but it did not budge in any direction.

They were stuck in this room.

"Most curious!" Rouxls declared. "There must be a puzzle afoot..." He glanced around, looking for something to actuate, and came across three breaker levers, a plugged power socket that seemed to lead into the machine, and a circuit box. All three of these were sitting between the machine and the doorway. "Aha! Perhaps we must findeth the correct sequence of levers in order to proceed!"

"I'm... really not sure we should touch anything in here, Duke..." Ralsei looked worriedly at the equipment around them. "All this looks very expensive..."

"Excuses, excuses!" declared Jevil, who was already fiddling with dials on the monitors. "One must learn to live by their own rules, young prince! Not by rules of others! That is your *true* freedom!"

"Wh- No, seriously!" Ralsei ran over to pull Jevil's hands away from the machines. "Something about this gives me a really bad-"

The metal door jolted to life, slowly sliding across.

The three turned...

And peeking in the doorway, holding a weapon in their direction and looking *very* confused, was a young adult *human* woman.

Her eyes darted between the young two-legged goat prince in the cloak and witch's hat, the squat imp-like creature in a clown costume and crosses over its eyes, and the human-*like* man who nonetheless was completely blue and white - skin and clothing.

"...Wow," the woman finally said. She shook her head. "The Combine must have put something new in the water recently."

She backed out from the door, and which began to close. Ralsei ran up to the closing gap and called, "Please help us! We are from the Dark World and the Card Kingdom, and we have no idea who we are or why you have summoned us!"

"Summoned?" came a older male voice from somewhere outside Ralsei's view of the next room. "We have done no such thing, in fact the Local Space Teleporter is currently in need of repair."

A man appeared in the view, walking to the doorway. He was balding, with square glasses, and wore a white suit with a button-up formal shirt and tie beneath. He peered at Ralsei curiously. "Fascinating. A sapient animal life form. I must ask, how *did* you get here?"

Ralsei cleared his throat. Something about this place didn't sit right. If this was the Light World, it was too starkly different in comparison to the Dark World - and the realities he had already visited. "I- There's three of us, sir. A, uh - a hole opened up in the dungeons of Card Castle. We had had word of similar... uhm... Rouxls," he glanced behind him, "what was the word the messenger used?"

"'Wormholes', Dark Prince."

"Yes, wormholes, thank you - opening up throughout our worlds. We were evacuating the Card Kingdom's prisoner when we got pulled into one, and ended up here."

"I see. So what you are saying is that you have been brought here from... another planet?"

"Um... another reality, actually."

"How interesting..." The man tapped a control button on the wall next to the door, and the large door began to slide open fully. "This could very well upend our understanding of dimensional theory. Oh, if only we could experiment like we once used to..."

As the man walked over to a computer desk in the middle of the room, the woman eyed them with concern, still holding the weapon in her hand, but not pointing it in the monsters' direction. "Uh, Dr. Kleiner? Are you sure they're not with the Combine or something? I mean, we've not seen anything like them before..."

"And just what is this 'Combine' you speak of?" Jevil asked, an odd little grin on his face.

"I'm certain it's the name of a farming machine the humans use," Ralsei responded, turning to him.

"Er... I mean, yes, but..." The woman shook her head. "Were I to be as lucky as you three."

"I am afraid the word 'Combine' means something much more sinister here," the man - Kleiner - responded. "However you ended up here, you are in luck. This facility is one of the few places on Earth still safe from the Combine, though it rests in a city completely under their control. Assuming you do not wish to be discovered, you'll need to find somewhere to sleep nearby..." He paused, in thought, then turned to his cohort. "Alyx, do you believe there is any place within this building that might be suitable for these creatures to lay low?"
