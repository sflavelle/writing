A green-haired head appeared in the doorway. "Hey Joel, you know the Game Boy I keep at my bedside? You know, the one I *always* keep at my bedside, and have always *kept* at my bedside?"

Joel looked up from his workbench, which was littered with PCBs and wires. "Yeah? What about it?"

"I can't help but notice it's not at my bedside. Are you using it for something?"

"Elly, What do you take me for? Some kind of parts...pincher... tinkerer? Tailor? ...Soldier Spy?" He raised an eyebrow.

"... Do you really need me to answer that?" The nerd narrowed her eyes. 

"Well, you're right," Joel continued nonchalantly. "I thought that Bonus Stage could use an upgrade."

"Really." Elly was unimpressed. "Well good call, maybe with the processor in that thing you can double the amount of actual interesting characters on this show," she snarked.

Joel Dawson finally turned away from the workbench toward Elly, a flat expression on his oval face. "Yeah. Sure. It's a real shame that you and Phil didn't work out."

"Come over and say that to my face, asshat."

"*Maybe I will.*"

Elly later found Phil standing outside the house with Rya, both looking at something with an odd expression. Popping up beside him, she greeted, "Hey, Phillian. Ryzom."

"Hey, Elly." Phil ignored the random nickname. "What are you doing with Joel's hair?"

Rya, the simulation's resident robot, turned to look. Yep. That sure was Joel's entire hairdo attached to her ass.

"`About time someone showed him what an asshat he is,`" Rya snarked.

"I beat you to that one already, Rya." Elly shrugged. "What's so interesting out here?"

"Take a look at this grass patch," he pointed. 

"Wow, that exciting huh."

"No, like, *really* look at it. Doesn't it look way more detailed then it should be?"

On closer inspection, yeah, it looked out of place in this show. Every other surface outside of the house was more or less flat colour beside landmarks and other points of interest, but this small square of grass had the *audacity* to have a small raised mound of dirt in its middle and *several* blades of grass at its edge. 

"I see Joel is putting the DMG to good use," Elly remarked.

"Huh?" Phil raised an eyebrow, but whatever he was going to say to Elly next was cut off as something appeared from the dirt. 

It... was a large buttercup flower.

Well, 'large' in that it reached to Phil's lack of knees.

And to Phil's horror, Elly's disappointment and Rya's disinterest, the flower had a *face*.

"Howdy!" It called, beaming. "I'm Flowey! Flowey the... hey, wait, that's not my voice!"

Indeed, it sounded like Phil's own voice, higher pitched and goofy sounding.

"What, you think Joel spends *money* on this show?" Phil scoffed. "You'll get the same voice actor as the rest of us and you'll be *happy*."

Flowey's grin dimmed. What did they mean, this was a 'show'? What happened to *his* voice?! Ugh, whatever, this wasn't the reason he came here. "Golly, you must be so confused!"
