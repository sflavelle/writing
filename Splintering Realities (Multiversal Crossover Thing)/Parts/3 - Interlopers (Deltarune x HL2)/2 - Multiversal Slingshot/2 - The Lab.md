And then, as Ralsei began to wonder if the Void would swallow them whole-

There was a flash of white, and a burst of sound, and suddenly the three monsters found themselves stood in the middle of a platform, barriers spinning wildly around them. Subconsciously the three pressed against each other, not eager to be hit by such high-speed objects.

The room was darkened, the only light being the sunlight from the window opposite the group. The machine made mechanical noises and a 'spinning down' kind of sound as the barriers slowed, and the platform holding them began to lower them to the ground - but apart from the machine dropping into this failsafe state, nothing else in the room was powered it would seem.

The platform clunked mechanically against the base of the machine, pressing into the floor, and the barriers settled into place at the back. The gate opened, finally allowing the monsters out, and all three of Ralsei, Rouxls Kaard, and Jevil gladly did so. "Is everyone okay?" Ralsei asked, catching their breath.

"Thankethfully," commented Rouxls, who was currently bent over, taking deep breaths and focusing their vision on the floor.

"Ueeheehee!" cried Jevil joyfully. "That was fun, fun! What freedom is this?"

Ralsei opened his mouth to respond and correct the jester, but the prince was interrupted by the sound of flickering lights and machines coming to life as the power returned to the room, temporarily knocked out by the transmission. An entire wall of machines to the right of the three monsters blinked to life, tiny lights bursting into color - some red, some green; some that flickered, some that didn't. Multiple screens blinked to life, computers booting up. The three also took proper notice now of the raised catwalk on the window side of the room, filled with what looked like another such computer, integrated into a desk or... something.

Finally, to their left was a doorway, currently closed with a massive metal panel. Jevil gave it a curious push, but it did not budge in any direction.

They were stuck in this room.

"Most curious!" Rouxls declared. "There must be a puzzle afoot..." He glanced around, looking for something to actuate, and came across three breaker levers, a plugged power socket that seemed to lead into the machine, and a circuit box. All three of these were sitting between the machine and the doorway. "Aha! Perhaps we must findeth the correct sequence of levers in order to proceed!"

"I'm... really not sure we should touch anything in here, Duke..." Ralsei looked worriedly at the equipment around them. "All this looks very expensive..."

"Excuses, excuses!" declared Jevil, who was already fiddling with dials on the monitors. "One must learn to live by their own rules, young prince! Not by rules of others! That is your *true* freedom!"

"Wh- No, seriously!" Ralsei ran over to pull Jevil's hands away from the machines. "Something about this gives me a really bad-"

The metal door jolted to life, slowly sliding across.

The three turned...

And in the doorway, holding a weapon in their direction and looking *very* confused, was a young adult woman.

Her eyes darted between the young goat prince in the cloak and witch's hat, the squat imp-like creature in a clown costume and crosses over its eyes, and the human-*like* man who nonetheless was completely blue - skin and clothing.

"...Wow," the woman finally said. She shook her head. "They must have put something new in the water recently."

She backed out from the door, and which began to close. Ralsei ran up to the closing gap and called, "Please help us! We are from the Dark World and the Card Kingdom, and we have no idea who we are or why you have summoned us!"
