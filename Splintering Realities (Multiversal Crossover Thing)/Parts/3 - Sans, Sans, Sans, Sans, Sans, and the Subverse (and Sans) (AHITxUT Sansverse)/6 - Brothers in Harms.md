Nightmare sat at the booth, in a corner of the 'Mafia HQ' as he waited. A coffee sat in front of him, conjured from the dream. He considered what he had heard tonight. 

The Creator had died in yesterday's attack. Another supposed immortal slain in this 'Moonjumper's attack on their worlds. And yet somehow, it had been beaten back in their attempt on the Destroyer...

What was their goal here? Gaining Error's ability to destroy, rip apart universes didn't make much sense. Was it really as the interlopers said? Did they *really* want to tear down the entire multiverse?

And what of ending Dream and himself? So far all that it seemed to accomplish was to prevent them both from interfering, and break the morale of their friends. Which undoubtedly with their power was a good idea, but-

The booth table jostled lightly, which caused Nightmare to look up as Dream slid into the opposite seat. He nodded. "You received my message."

Dream looked quite beaten down after the events of the last few days. He nodded quietly. "Couldn't help but notice you lingering here."

Nightmare nodded again, in lieu of any real response.

"I still can't believe we're dead," Dream muttered softly, leaning forward and resting his skull on the table, and then resting his arms there as well, hands knitted together on the back of his head. "And yet Ink is just... gone."

Nightmare took a sip of the coffee in front of him. "He may not be," he conceded. "We already had this ability. It is possible that his... unique composition might... aid him. But..."

"... it might not," Dream finished. Who knew, when their current state flew in the face of everything they'd known to this point? 

Both skeletons were silent for a time. 

"We've been derelicting our duties," Dream finally said, raising his head from the table, a grim look on his face. 

"*Do* we have duties anymore?" Nightmare raised a brow. 

"I think," Dream responded almost immediately, "that we have a responsibility to our friends and coworkers to inform them that we aren't completely gone."

"And what would the point of that be?" His brother asked. "We cannot provide anything for them anymore. All we would be doing is forcing them to process our removal from their lives."

"That is *exactly* why we should at least visit them. Give them a chance to at least say goodbye properly before we... before I go."

Nightmare paused. He leaned in over the booth. "Are you *falling down*, brother?" He asked slowly, his expression strangely concerned. 

"No? Er- Oh! No, no!" Dream briefly plastered a grin on his face and pretended to swat Nightmare away. "No, sorry. But uh- I've decided that... I'm going to follow along with the interlopers. It just seems... right, you know? Maybe there's still some way for me to help fix all this."

Nightmare raised his eyes to meet his brother's, examining him. "...Heh," he finally said. "That's so like you. I'm not surprised - not even death can truly keep you down."

"You should come with me," the gold skeleton blurted out. "I mean - we don't have to be guardians... not the same way we were. But they're going to need all the help they can get. This... arms race to prevent Moonjumper from erasing everything... maybe we can help, tip the scales in our favour."

Nightmare thought on this. "...I suppose if anything, it would be nice to be the one to take down this threat."
