Cross's smile strained, taking a deep breath he didn't need. "alright. i'll call 'em out. hey uh... be nice to them, alright? they wanna help."

"sure thing, boss."

Sans, Frisk and Flowey watched as the other Sans stepped across the room, turning away from them momentarily.

Cross suddenly slouched, his posture dropping as if a sudden wave of exhaustion had hit him... before he straightened up, holding himself tall, something that... really didn't look right on him. He took his hands out of his hoodie pockets, and his guests watched how his digits flexed, almost fidgeting, before finally settling with holding his hands behind his back.

Another unnecessary deep breath, and...

Cross turned around on one heel to face them.

And in a voice not his own, his usual grin thinned down into a small smile, they spoke in a young, nervous, *familiar* voice.

"Greetings. I am Chara Dreemurr of X-Tale."

Sans' eyelights immediately sputtered out, Frisk gasped in awe, and Flowey's eyes went wide.

He had immediately seen how Cross's eyelights had shifted from their normal white to a familiar, *determined* blood red.

Even as Sans had to mentally remind himself '*not our chara, not our chara*', he spoke after a moment of silence, "i thought *chara* was your first name."

"I--" 'Chara' blinked, confused. "Yes it is...?"

"well then who's ekstaels?"

Flowey and 'Chara' blinked at him. Then the flower gently thwapped at his side with a leaf, causing him to jolt and his eyes to light back up, while the other let out a soft giggle. "You idiot, I think that's their universe or whatever."

'Chara' nodded, and their smile widened, just a bit. "That is how our friends refer to the Underground from which we came from, yes. I wish that they had told you more about the whole... 'alternate universes' situation going on, so, for the sake of clarity, allow me to educate you on the nature of this multiverse--"

"Subverse," cut in Flowey.

"You'll have to explain to us what that kid means by that later." They sighed, then continued. "...before we get to what I can tell you about, well, myself, and how that *might* relate to the Chara *you're* dealing with."

It felt weird to Sans, knowing that this version of him that had been so helpful, was now suddenly possessed with the spirit of the First Fallen Human, and yet was supposedly *not* the same Chara that had attacked *his* Underground and killed his brother. Yes, he had just met multiple versions of *himself*. That felt... different, somehow. "wait, so... you know the *name* of your universe? is that... important?"

"Well, it's... sorta?" Chara scratched at the back of their skull, turning toward a desk to rummage through its contents. "A lot of AUs here start from one of several archetypes, so we know what to expect if someone says, 'it's a Swapfell verse' or 'an Outerverse' or something like that... Each new AU will have some difference or another, even if it's on a small scale but... It's rare that we get something new-- er, something *unique* on a multiversal scale."

Eventually they found a bit of unused paper and a pen, and Chara beckoned the three closer as they shifted down into a prone position, laying on their front with the paper in front of them. Sans realised there was still a bit of youth in them. 

"It goes like this." Chara drew a quick circle and began to write as they addressed their audience. "Sans, do you know why we initially called you Classic?"

"it's cause i'm a classy guy, right?" came the other's response. Frisk giggled.

"Should've seen that coming," Chara sighed. "Our worlds all have a common code. A baseline to work from. A cast of actors from which the multiverse modifies to play new roles. But the original... what all this is based on... is your universe. And, uh, Classic's universe." They gestured with the pen toward the circle on the paper, in which they had written the word 'Undertale'. "We know this universe as 'Undertale', found in the base code somewhere in the Void."

They drew a line from that circle, and began to draw a new circle below it. "Now, a lot of the 'main cast' comes in pairs, right? Toriel, Asgore; Sans, Papyrus; Chara, Frisk; Flowey, Temmie..."

"... How am I anything like those annoying mutts?" Flowey scoffed.

"Blame the code," Chara shrugged. "Now, what if we swapped them around...? Gave one monster the other's role, the other's personality?"

"huhhhh," Sans said, realising. "that's how you get blue."

Chara nodded. "He comes from one of these universes. Fittingly, we call them 'Underswap'." They began drawing new lines and circles from Undertale, opposing their new Underswap circle and forming a triangle between the three. "On the other hand, monsters in your universe are made of love and compassion, yes? So of *course* we have to have darker, edgier monsters who live the 'kill or be killed' your resident maniac espouses." Chara nodded toward Flowey with a smirk, who made some sort of growling noise in response, then pointed down at the new 'Underfell' circle they had made.

Then, they started adding to their diagram, splitting off of the triangle of these three archetypes. "Oh, but what if we mixed these two premises?" Swapfell. "What if we put the Underground through even *harsher* circumstances?!" Horrortale. "What if *humans* were the ones trapped Underground?" Overtale. "Fuck it, let's put the monsters in outer space!" Chara laughed, genuinely, while adding 'Outertale'. 

"What if, with Determination's control over your timeline, Sans decided to raise his own determination and LV to break the Fallen Human's hold over the Underground?" Dusttale. "What if all the resets... The defeats... The *deaths*... broke you down, Sans, and one day Chara comes by and instead of killing you again... Hands *you* the knife?" Finally they wrote down 'Something New' and began to write down names next to each AU circle.

"... you're joking," Sans choked out, eyelights small as pinpricks. "i couldn't... i could never... you're seriously telling me some of the sanses out there have slaughtered their underground?"

"They saw it as their only choice," Chara said casually. "Dust succeeded in stopping the resets, but, well, he didn't have anyone to celebrate with at the end, did he?" Their smirk deepened. "*Not even their brother.*"

"**no.**" Sans knew he shouldn't be getting riled up, but the idea of *him* hurting Papyrus was sickening. "that cannot be me."

"But it is. It's a version of you that couldn't take the endless loops of genocide, that thought the ends might justify the means. *You* managed to avoid that. Take solace in the fact that Papyrus is still with him *in spirit*."

"Oooh, *that's* what that is," Flowey suddenly said, understanding. "I thought the guy had lost his marbles."

"No, well... that's Killer, I suppose." Chara shrugged. "He's the one that really went off the deep end to become who he is now."
