Cross's smile strained, taking a deep breath he didn't need. "alright. i'll call 'em out. hey uh... be nice to them, alright? they wanna help."

"sure thing, boss."

Sans, Frisk and Flowey watched as the other Sans stepped across the room, turning away from them momentarily.

Cross suddenly slouched, his posture dropping as if a sudden wave of exhaustion had hit him... before he straightened up, holding himself tall, something that... really didn't look right on him. He took his hands out of his hoodie pockets, and his guests watched how his digits flexed, almost fidgeting, before finally settling with holding his hands behind his back.

Another unnecessary deep breath, and...

Cross turned around on one heel to face them.

And in a voice not his own, his usual grin thinned down into a small smile, they spoke in a young, nervous, *familiar* voice.

"Greetings. I am X-Tale's Chara Dreemurr."

Sans' eyelights immediately sputtered out, and Flowey's eyes went wide.

He had immediately seen how Cross's eyelights had shifted from their normal white to a *determined* blood red

Even as Sans had to mentally remind himself '*not our chara, not our chara*', he spoke after a moment of silence, "i thought *chara* was your first name."

"I--" 'Chara' blinked, confused. "Yes it is...?"

"well then who's ekstaels?"

Flowey and 'Chara' blinked at him. Then the flower gently thwapped at his side with a leaf, causing him to jolt and his eyes to light back up, while the other let out a soft giggle. "You idiot, I think that's their universe."

'Chara' nodded, and their smile widened, just a bit. "That is how our friends refer to us, yes. I wish that they had told you more about the whole... 'alternate universes' situation going on, so, for the sake of clarity, allow me to educate you on the nature of this multiverse--"

"Subverse," cut in Flowey.

"You'll have to explain to me what that kid means by that later." They sighed, then continued. "...before we get to what I can tell you about, well, myself, and how that *might* relate to the Chara *you're* dealing with."

It felt weird to Sans, knowing that this version of him that had been so helpful, was now suddenly possessed with the spirit of the First Fallen Human, and yet was supposedly *not* the same Chara that had attacked the Underground and killed his brother. Yes, he had just met multiple versions of *himself*. That felt... different, somehow. "wait, so... you know the *name* of your universe? is that... important?"
