In the midst of all of the chaos they had walked into, Sans only saw it coming a split-second before it happened.

One of the battling skeletons - one of the *hims* in the fray, with greying clothing - had spotted his group and summoned a Blaster, aiming right at them.

"KID-!" Sans shouted in warning.

The Gaster Blaster fired.

He heard something happen behind him even as he flinched back.

But...

Nothing hit him.

In fact, he didn't hear it hit anything.

And... the room had gone quiet.

His eyelights blinked open.

The room was ensconced in a shimmering, eerie green light.

And all the skeletons were frozen in place, all their attacks hanging in the air, even as their eyes all locked on him and his friends.

...And Cross.

Cross and Sans looked about them for the source of the anomaly, and found it in Hat Kid's activated Time Stop Hat, its green fabric glowing and floating, even as she, Mu, and Frisk all breathed a sigh of relief. Toriel stared at the scene in shock.

And Flowey... well.

"Aww, why'd you stop it kid?!" the manic flower whined from Frisk's backpack, . "It was just about to get real good!"

Sans shook his head, and took a deep breath he didn't need.

He stepped out into the room, feeling multiple pairs of eyes on him. Stepping around multiple attacks, frozen in time,  he stood in the center of the room, where nothing would immediately harm him once time restarted, and he slowly turned in place to look at all the different versions of himself.

The one nearest him wore a black jacket atop a red shirt. Their teeth were almost shark-like, and one was-- was that gold? That was gold. This edgy bastard has a gold tooth.

He was mid-bone-attack with what seemed like an artist version of him - this one was about to counter the attack with a... giant paintbrush? It reminded him of that 'turf war' game the kids played back on the spaceship. He recognised his own jacket tied around the painter's waist, and a color scheme of browns and blues. One of his eyes was... in the shape of a star? Okay. And he wore a bandolier in which he could see several vials with some sorta liquid in them. Potions? He wasn't sure.

The next Sans along made his soul hurt, and absently he felt for Paps' scarf around his neck. Because he could see immediately that this guy was... 'Papyrus but Sans' was the best way he could put it. If he had ever taken his brother up on the 'costume party' idea he had had however many years back, this would be how he would have looked.

He was facing Grey again. Now that he was closer, he could see the grittiness of the grey jacket, shirt... His lazy grin strained.

That was monster dust.

In another life, he had killed.

He quickly moved along.

His eyesockets widened as the next skeleton had *a third of his fucking skull missing*. He was bigger too, giving him a sort of hulking appearance. The axe he held in his hands looked quite sharp, and the single eyelight that watched him - the other seemingly snuffed out for good with his injury - felt... slightly dull, but curious. Cautious. What had happened to the guy?

The last skeleton to meet would have seemed fairly normal, only a black shirt and sneakers standing out to him clothing-wise. If not for the black streaks coming from blank eye sockets, and a magical 'target' branding over his SOUL... he was handling a knife too, and not a magical one - was it the same knife that ~~Frisk~~ Chara had once wielded against him?

His eyes flickered back to Tori and the others. With Cross they had moved safely out of the way of the blast that had been fired at them. Hattie gave him a look. "I don't have much left on this time stop."

Sans nodded. He'd have to get straight to the point then. "right-o. alright fellas, sorry to interrupt playtime, but we're here after someone called the moonjumper. last known signal was somewhere in this area. now here's what's gonna happen. this encounter's gonna stop, and you're gonna tell us if anything abnormal has been happening lately."

"Five seconds," noted Hat Kid.

"oh, and if anyone tries to make a move on tori, the kids or even the weed," ("Hey!" Flowey scowled) "i don't think i need to tell you what's gonna happen."

The shimmering green light dissipated, and time unfroze around them.

The various skeletons mid-attack stumbled to a stop as the remnants of their attacks crashed against the walls or furniture. Others teleported away from the attacks they had seen coming for the minutes that time had been frozen.

The atmosphere was so tense you could cut it with a knife.

"was wonderin' where you fucked off to, crossy," said the edgy red Sans, eyeing Cross even as kept himself in a battle-ready stance. His eyelights snapped back to Sans himself, and he spat, "you're a long way from home, classic."

"don't i know it." Sans shrugged. "well, now that i've got that out of the way, i got a question for you all."

He closed his eyes, and when he opened them again, his eyelights had gone out.

"*what the fuck am i looking at.*"

Flowey barked out a laugh, as did 'Dusty'. 'The Hulk' even let out a low chuckle.
