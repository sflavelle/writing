In the midst of all of the chaos they had walked into, Sans only saw it coming a split-second before it happened.

One of the battling skeletons - one of the *hims* in the fray, with greying clothing - had spotted his group and summoned a Blaster, aiming right at them.

"KID-!" Sans shouted in warning.

The Gaster Blaster fired.

He heard something happen behind him even as he flinched back.

But...

Nothing hit him.

In fact, he didn't hear it hit anything.

And... the room had gone quiet.

His eyelights blinked open.

The room was ensconced in a shimmering, eerie green light.

And all the skeletons were frozen in place, all their attacks hanging in the air, even as their eyes all locked on him and his friends.

...And Cross.

Cross and Sans looked about them for the source of the anomaly, and found it in Hat Kid's activated Time Stop Hat, its green fabric glowing and floating, even as she, Mu, and Frisk all breathed a sigh of relief. Toriel stared at the scene in shock.

And Flowey... well.

"Aww, why'd you stop it kid?!" the manic flower whined from Frisk's backpack, . "It was just about to get real good!"

Sans shook his head and huffed out a low chuckle. Flowey, man.

He stepped out into the room, feeling multiple pairs of eyes on him. Stepping around multiple attacks, frozen in time,  he stood in the center of the room, where nothing would immediately harm him once time restarted, and he slowly turned in place to look at all the different versions of himself.

The one nearest him wore a black jacket atop a red shirt. Their teeth were almost shark-like, and one was-- was that gold? That was gold. This edgy bastard has a gold tooth.

He was mid-bone-attack with what seemed like an artist version of him - this one was about to counter the attack with a... giant paintbrush? It reminded him of that 'turf war' video game the kids played back on the spaceship. He recognised his own jacket tied around the painter's waist, and a color scheme of browns and blues. One of his eyes was... in the shape of a star? Okay, that looked a little odd on a skeleton, but who was he to judge. And he wore a bandolier in which he could see several vials with some sorta liquid in them. Potions? He wasn't sure.

The next Sans along made his soul hurt, and absently he felt for Paps' scarf around his neck. Because he could see immediately that this guy was... 'Papyrus but Sans' was the best way he could put it. If he had ever taken his brother up on the 'costume party' idea he had had however many years back, this would be how he would have looked.

He was facing Grey again. Now that he was closer, he could see the grittiness of the grey jacket, shirt... His lazy grin strained.

That wasn't grit. It was monster dust.

In another life, he had killed.

He quickly moved along.

His eyesockets widened as the next skeleton had *a third of his fucking skull missing*. He was bigger too, giving him a sort of hulking appearance. The axe he held in his hands looked quite sharp, and the single eyelight that watched him - the other seemingly snuffed out for good with his injury - felt... slightly dull, but curious. Cautious. What had happened to the guy?

The last skeleton to meet would have seemed fairly normal, only a black shirt and sneakers standing out to him clothing-wise. If not for the black streaks coming from blank eye sockets, and a magical 'target' branding over his SOUL... he was handling a knife too, and not a magical one - was it the same knife that ~~Frisk~~ Chara had once wielded against him?

His eyes flickered back to Tori and the others. With Cross they had moved safely out of the way of the blast that had been fired at them. Hattie gave him a look. "I don't have much left on this time stop."

Sans nodded. He'd have to get straight to the point then. "right-o. alright fellas, sorry to interrupt playtime, but we're here after someone called the moonjumper. last known signal was somewhere in this area. now here's what's gonna happen. this encounter's gonna stop, and you're gonna tell us if anything abnormal has been happening lately."

"Five seconds," noted Hat Kid.

"oh, and if anyone tries to make a move on tori, the kids or even the weed," ("Hey!" Flowey scowled) "i don't think i need to tell you what's gonna happen."

The shimmering green light dissipated, and time unfroze around them.

The various skeletons mid-attack stumbled to a stop as the remnants of their attacks crashed against the walls or furniture. Others teleported away from the attacks they had seen coming for the minutes that time had been frozen.

The atmosphere was so tense you could cut it with a knife.

"was wonderin' where you fucked off to, crossy," said the edgy red Sans, eyeing Cross even as kept himself in a battle-ready stance. His eyelights snapped back to Sans himself, and he spat, "you're a long way from home, classic."

"don't i know it." Sans shrugged, disregarding the nickname for now. He wasn't sure what that meant. "well, now that i've got that out of the way, i got a question for you all."

He closed his eyes, and when he opened them again, his eyelights had gone out.

"*what the fuck am i looking at.*"

Flowey barked out a laugh, as did 'Dusty'. 'The Hulk' even let out a low chuckle. 

Papyrus Sans was the first to respond, rushing forward toward the time traveller, looking as if he is meeting his idol - starry eyes and all. "It Is An Honour To Welcome The Original Sans Into The Multiverse! Although, You've Come At A Bad Time. These Villainous Rapscallions Have Somehow Destroyed The Guardian Of Positivity!"

"Told you already Blue," shrugged the one with the target over his chest. "Wasn't us. We don't even know where Dream hides to even go near him."

"killer's right," muttered Dust. "plus, you and *that* freak," he nodded at the painter, "snuck in here and offed our boss, so don't go pretending you're the innocent one."

"We Did Not!" Blue growled. "We Didn't Even Have Access To Your Castle Until Cross Came To Find Us!"

"okay, hang on." Sans raised his palms. "gonna need some context here."

"...Yes, I'm afraid so," agreed Toriel, confused and concerned. "I take it then, that your sides have always fought?"

"yeah..." The hulking Sans nodded, adjusting his hold on the axe he carried. "me n' dusty... red, cross, killer... we're all outcasts. made s'm... poor choices... had a rough life."

"But they chose to align themselves with the Corrupted Guardian Of Negativity," proclaimed the artist. "Their actions have caused the suffering of millions across the multiverse."

"agree to disagree," snapped Red. "nightmare's only fulfilling his duties. gives us somewhere to call home. makes us feel part of something again."

"But Then Why Spread--"

Sans rested a hand on Blue's shoulder to cut him off. "i think i'm seeing it. dream, nightmare, positivity, negativity. but if this conflict has been so... ever present, why has *this* happened now? either one of 'em coulda died before this point, yeah?"

"...Well, No." Blue scratched at the back of his skull. "They Are Both Supposed To Be Immortal."

Sans gave the kids a pointed look. "do they have any particular abilities? something that could be useful to, let's say, an omnicidal maniac?"

"...I guess the one they're most known for is in the name," Killer shrugged. "They can both visit the Dreamscape and do... kinda whatever in people's dreams or nightmares."

"They Also, Mostly Nightmare, Feed Off Of Emotions. Siphoning Them Away Or Spreading Them Further With Their Auras."

"What, like an emotional vampire?" Snatcher asked, entering into the room from a different entrance, and promptly tanking a surprised Dust's blaster with no reaction, only remarking after the fact. "Already dead, kiddo. Good reflex though."

"...s'mthin' like that," shrugged Horror, unphased by the additional guest. "it's how they get their power."

"huh. i mean, maybe there's something there for our guy..." Sans 'hmm'ed and turned toward Hat Kid, who had moved to join him. Out of the corner of his eyelights, he noticed Dust suddenly cock his head to one side, looking toward the doorway to what seemed to be the kitchen, speaking to... no one? "what do ya reckon, kid? moonjumper material?"

Hattie shrugged, but nodded. "Going off of what we know, I could see him doing it. If he's trashing the multiverse though, I'm not too sure..."

"I have to agree with the brat," added Snatcher, floating closer. "He already *has* the ability to visit dreams. And I'm not sure what the ability to siphon emotions is going to do for him."

"oh. you're right." Dust said suddenly to nobody in particular, eyes wide, and Sans and Hattie glanced at him. His eyes widened as the dusty skeleton approached him, eyes focused on him in... concern? Dust wasn't looking at his face though...

"um. dude?" Sans leaned away slightly as Dust came up to him, but otherwise made no effort to retreat. He watched as the other skeleton carefully, with reverence, brushed his fingers over Paps' scarf.

The other skeleton sighed sadly. "...'m sorry bout your bro, classic."

*Oh.*

The other skeletons around him flinched as they also took in the scarf, for what seemed like the first time.

"aw, shit dude," Red had the sense to look honestly shocked. "that's not fair. your paps doesn't deserve that fate."
