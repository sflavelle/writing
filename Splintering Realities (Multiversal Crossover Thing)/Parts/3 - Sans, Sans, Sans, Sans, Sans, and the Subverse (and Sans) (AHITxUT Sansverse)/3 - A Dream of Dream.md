### A Dream of Dream

After meeting all the strange versions of Sans - especially those more murdery ones - Mustache Girl expected a rougher sleep.

And yet, she couldn't complain about remembering what Seaside *used* to be like. 

It was a quiet night on the docks of Seaside. The kind of night she always missed when the Mafia arrived - when the island town was sleepy, barely anyone around, and she and her old man would walk down to watch the sun set over the distant ocean horizon. He would set the fishing line, and she would keep him company while they both ate from their bag of hot fish and chips from the nearby takeaway.

Mu smiled to herself and watched the fishing boats in the distance. Pop must have gone to get their hot chocolates from the cafe, something else they would normally enjoy out here. It's a shame Hattie never got to experience this side of Seaside...

"Here you are." Right on cue, a steaming mug was held in front of her.

"Aw, thanks Pops," Mu beamed, reaching to take the mug from--

She paused.

...from the skeletal hand in front of her.

She took the mug, her eyes following the appendage, up the arm, to yet another version of Sans.

This one seemed fairly relaxed, beaming down at her in greeting. The first thing she noticed was his whole... whatever his 'bright yellow' palette thing was about. The only thing about him that wasn't was a light blue polo, complementing and contrasting with his boots and the cape wrapped around his shoulders. Even his eyes were the same kind of yellow.

It was the golden headpiece he adorned that gave her the best clue to who this actually was, though. She chuckled, finally accepting the cup. "The gold's a little on the nose, don't you think?"

The skeleton was self-aware enough to at least chuckle sheepishly, phalanges scraping at the back of his skull. "It wouldn't quite be me without it," he admitted. He nodded at the space next to Mu. "Mind if I take a seat?"

"I *guess*." Mustache Girl rolled her eyes. The sudden appearance of this skeleton, out of place in her memory, made it clear what was happening. "So I suppose I'm dreaming then."

"Yup." The skeleton chuckled once more as he shifted into a seated position, letting his legs dangle off the pier. Mu watched him look around at the world around him.

Then it hit her.

"...*Ohhhh*, *you're* Dream," she realised aloud. "Because I'm *dreaming*."

Dream couldn't help a giggle. "Yup! Mind you, I don't *only* exist in the dreamscape."

Mu nodded. "I didn't think so. I mean, we saw the-- uh, what was left of the other one."

"You mean my brother?" He raised a brow bone.

"Nightmare's your broth-- oh. Right. Yeah. Dream and Nightmare. That makes sense." She shook her head with a chuckle, and sipped from her hot chocolate. It still tasted just as she remembered, just as magical as it felt all those years ago. Thoughts of a simpler time swirled through her mind.

Thankfully Dream let her enjoy the moment, looking around him at Seaside, still curious about the world she dreamed of.

Mustache Girl finished a particularly long sip. "I thought- Okay, forgive me for being blunt, it's just... who I am - the loud blue one said you died."

"In a sense, yes." He sighed. "Quite... annoying, I must be honest. But I still somewhat exist, as you can see! Even if I no longer have a physical body..."

"Are we on the right track, then? Was it Moonjumper that did... this?" She gestured at his body.

"Oh, I was always able to visit dreams," Dream shrugged. "But yes... At least, I assume this 'Moonjumper' and the odd glitching character in the red suit that murdered me are the same."

Mu nodded. "Sounds like him. 's... why we're here and all that."
