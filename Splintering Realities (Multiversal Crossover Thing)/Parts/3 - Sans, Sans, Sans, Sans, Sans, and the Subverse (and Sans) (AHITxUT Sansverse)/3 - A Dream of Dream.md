### A Dream of Dream

After meeting all the strange versions of Sans - especially those more murdery ones - Mustache Girl expected a rougher sleep.

And yet, she couldn't complain about remembering what Seaside *used* to be like. 

It was a quiet night on the docks of Seaside. The kind of night she always missed when the Mafia arrived - when the island town was sleepy, barely anyone around, and she and her old man would walk down to watch the sun set over the distant ocean horizon. He would set the fishing line, and she would keep him company while they both ate from their bag of hot fish and chips from the nearby takeaway.

Mu smiled to herself and watched the fishing boats in the distance. Pop must have gone to get their hot chocolates from the cafe, something else they would normally enjoy out here. It's a shame Hattie never got to experience this side of Seaside...

"Here you are." Right on cue, a steaming mug was held in front of her.

"Aw, thanks Pops," Mu beamed, reaching to take the mug from--

She paused.

...from the skeletal hand in front of her.

She took the mug, her eyes following the appendage, up the arm, to yet another version of Sans.

This one seemed fairly relaxed, beaming down at her in greeting. The first thing she noticed was his whole... whatever his 'bright yellow' palette thing was about. The only thing about him that wasn't was a light blue polo, complementing and contrasting with his boots and the cape wrapped around his shoulders. Even his eyes were the same kind of yellow.

It was the golden tiara headpiece he adorned that gave her the best clue to who this actually was, though. She chuckled, finally bringing the cup toward herself. "The gold's a little on the nose, don't you think?"

The skeleton was self-aware enough to at least chuckle sheepishly, digits scraping at the back of his skull. "It wouldn't quite be me without it," he admitted. He nodded at the space next to Mu. "Mind if I take a seat?"

"I *guess*." Mustache Girl rolled her eyes. The sudden appearance of this skeleton, out of place in her memory, made it clear what was happening. "So I suppose I'm dreaming then."

"Yup." The skeleton chuckled once more as he shifted into a seated position, letting his legs dangle off the pier. Mu watched him look around at the world around him.

Then it hit her.

"...*Ohhhh*, *you're* Dream," she realised aloud. "Because I'm *dreaming*."

Dream couldn't help a giggle. "Yup! Nice to meet you. Mind you, I don't *only* exist in the dreamscape."

Mu nodded. "I didn't think so. I mean, we saw the-- uh, what was left of the other one."

"You mean my brother?" He raised a brow bone.

"Nightmare's your broth-- oh. Right. Yeah. Dream and Nightmare. That makes sense." She shook her head with a chuckle, and sipped from her hot chocolate. It still tasted just as she remembered, just as magical as it felt all those years ago. Thoughts of a simpler time swirled through her mind.

Thankfully Dream let her enjoy the moment, looking around him at Seaside, still curious about the world she dreamed of.

Mustache Girl finished a particularly long sip. "I thought- Okay, forgive me for being blunt, it's just... who I am - the loud blue one said you died."

Dream was startled into laughter. It was true, but he hadn't heard anyone refer to Blue in quite that way before! "In a sense, yes." He sighed, and quickly after his expression dropped. "Quite... annoying, I must be honest. My brother and I are both supposed to be functionally immortal, you see, so..." He clicked his tongue in thought. "But I still somewhat exist, as you can see! Even if I no longer have a physical body..."

"Are we on the right track, then? Was it Moonjumper that did... this?" She gestured at his body.

"Oh, I was always able to visit dreams," Dream shrugged. "But yes... At least, I assume this 'Moonjumper' and the odd glitching character in the red suit that murdered me are the same."

Mu nodded. "Sounds like him. 's... why we're here and all that." She blinked. "Is... Nightmare also visiting us?"

"I don't sense him *here*," the skeleton replied quickly. "But considering the problem I would not be surprised if he was also reaching out, making contact with one of your friends. I do apologise for tha--"

Mu held up a hand to stop him, and Dream startled into silence, surprised by the action. "Look, no offence, I don't need to know the backstory between you two. If we don't do something though, your killer will undo the entire multiverse. And not just this... cluster of parallel... alternative universes or whatever's going on."

"... What about the nightmare thing?" He asked sheepishly.

"Visiting Snatcher or Hattie? They'll be fine," she waved off his concerns. 

----

"Alright Moony, wherever you are, you utter *pile*," Snatcher grumbled as he floated through the frozen, silent Subcon Forest - a version he'd worried about when Vanessa became more of a 'problem'. "You and I *both* know I don't sleep anymore. I'm a friggin' ghost for Pete's sake! So come on out and let me rip the *shit* out of you!" 

His magic flared inside him, the urge to strike something hot in his mind... even if he was currently in what was apparently a magically-induced sleep. 

But there was nothing to take it out on. His minions, the dwellers, not even any Mafia simpletons stumbling their way through. 

... Although...

He felt a pull, a draw, from the other side of the Village - where his magical laboratory stood.

Something was waiting for him there. 

Well, if *that* was how it was going to be... He slid silently into the shadows, moving effortlessly under the surface toward his target. 

And then, once he felt as though he were right underneath his prey, he burst out from the ground laughing--

And something slimy and acidic immediately wrapped itself around Snatcher's neck, pulling and redirecting his trajectory such that he was slammed firmly into the floor of his lab and promptly pinned.

"A laudable attempt, Snatcher. Unfortunately, one's thoughts and intents are not quite as private as you would expect, in the dreamscape."

The ghost grumbled as the stranger's appendage retracted from him, and he turned his head to face his opponent - only to frown in confusion. 

It was another skeleton, though one he had not seen yet. This one wore a black turtleneck sweater and formal dress pants, and a mass of black, oily sludge that seemed to coalesce around his back... where four tentacles(?) sprouted, made of the same substance, currently aimed at him. The singular cyan eye that watched him was calm, perhaps amused.

Lifting himself upright, Snatcher crossed his arms in front of him. "You look like something that came up out of my swamp. Just how many of you skeletons are there?"

The skeleton's grin compressed into a smirk and began to pace around the spectre. "I am something *more* than my peers. Born to balance out the ideals of this multiverse. Some believed our war to be one of 'good versus evil' and other such simplifications, and that the only acceptable outcome for one side is the complete and total annihilation of the other. This is not the case."

"I remember hearing something from your 'peers' about positivity and negativity," Snatcher said flatly.

"Indeed. Too much positivity in the multiverse can become toxic. However, so too can negativity do the same. There is a balance that must be struck. This is something that my brother and I, and indeed the general public, have fundamentally disagreed on for many decades."

He continued, "There are two dangerous entities that we know of that do not care for this balance. The God of Destruction of this multiverse, Error, is one of them." The skeleton paused in place, turning toward his audience. "And evidently, this 'Moonjumper' creature who has managed to destroy my physical form - whom you and your team are following - is another. Error is a known quantity to us. This Moonjumper is not."

"You're talking to me as if you still have a horse in this race," Snatcher told him, narrowing his eyes. "How are you even doing this?"

Nightmare smirked. "Even before our demise, my brother and I were capable of traversing the dreamscape. Now, it would appear to be our only way of communication. I am here before you to provide the context you will require while you are here."

----

Sans dodged once more as Frisk attempted to slash at him. In what was quickly becoming routine, he stepped to the side and flung a few more jagged bones in the anomaly's direction.

~~Frisk~~ charged him once more, and he blocked the knife swing with his own attack, their weapons clashing. He looked down into the face of the child, expecting some horrid grin, but--

Frisk was fearful, *crying*. Tears already streaked down their face.

They choked out something.

"H-help me... Please..."

"frisk?!" Sans' eyelights bulged and he blinked to the far end of the hall, opting to take a grander look at the scene.

Frisk shambled around to face him. It again looked very... something about it disturbed the skeleton. And for just a moment...

The light in the room seemed to reflect off strings, lines... that wrapped around Frisk's limbs, almost invisible.

"heh." Okay, now Sans could see what was happening. Frisk was being puppeted by something... or someone.

If he could aim a sharper attack without Frisk moving...

But something beat him to it.

From the darkness beyond the hall, a powerful beam of light, not unlike one of his own Blasters, struck something above Frisk.

He caught a glimpse of - was that Chara? - disintegrating in the heat and power of the blast, and Frisk's strings were cut loose. They collapsed to the ground, and with a trembling hand tossed the blade away.

The blast died out, and Sans wanted to see who had fired... but first he warped to Frisk, carefully checking them over. They were trembling, and when he carefully turned their head, they were still crying, but they gave him a soft, genuine smile. "T-thank you..."

"Interesting," mused a voice from the dark, where the blaster had come from.

Sans and Frisk both flinched. The skeleton helped the human to their feet, noting that they seemed... 'normal' now, for whatever definition of normal they had in their unique situation. They both turned to face the darkness. "and just what is so interesting?"

A shape strode from the darkness into the light, and as it did the darkness engulfing the entrance to Asgore's throne room seemed to fade. It was a skeleton - another Sans. But the clothes and the *mass* that made up this one's tentacles, that matched those mixed throughout the dust in the study they had seen - was enough of an indicator of who they were talking with.

"It would seem that both of you share the same nightmare," the new skeleton mused. "I had to expend no effort at all to get you both into the same shared dreamspace."

"shared...? wait." He looked toward the human. "frisk, is that... *actually* you?"

Frisk carefully nodded. "...You're real, Sans?"

"yeah i am kid. you're okay now." He glanced back at the other entity in the room. "and you must be nightmare. right? do we have you to thank for all that?"

"*That* display was all you, I'm afraid." Nightmare smirked toward them. "I may have pushed things slightly to allow myself to manifest here, but, well. You would be surprised... or perhaps not, to learn just how many of your doppelgangers have poor memories of this exact room."

----

"It seems we've had the same idea," Nightmare mused as he appeared on the bridge of a spaceship. Evidently the child was dreaming of space.

Dream was startled into turning around, having been standing at the captain's chair staring out into the deep space outside. "Nightmare! I knew it couldn't have just been me!" A golden bow and arrow flickered into existence in his hands as he strung it, aiming at the intruding force.

Nightmare simply sighed, slowly walking toward the other. "Come now, brother. There is no need to battle. We have both already lost. You are also helping inform these interlopers on the being that slew us, are you not?"

The guardian of positivity frowned, raising an eyebrow in confusion. "...Yes...?"

"I doubt there is much more we can do about the roles we played in the waking world. What we *can* do, I believe, is if these beings are here because of our killer, then we can tell them what we know. Then perhaps, we might also learn some information about them."

Nightmare approached his brother, going to stand on the opposite side of the captain's chair, and looked out into the void of space. Dream, more out of confusion than anything, lowered his bow.

"For example, brother. I have learned from one of their number that the entity was already travelling the multiverses before it became what they call 'Moonjumper'. It came from an abandoned universe which, from what I understand is now part of the Void. *That* was its home."

"The Void?" Dream narrowed his eyes at his counterpart. "Nothing's supposed to be able to survive in the Void."

"You know as well as I do just how many Gasters have ended up there."

"Yes, and look what happened to them! They--"

The sound of a door sliding open caused Dream to pause, both skeletons turning from the window to look behind them.

A child, the child they were here for, slid into the room, dressed in pajamas and holding a crow monster plush, and eyed the both of them. "What're..." She cut herself off with a yawn. "...What're you doing talking so loudly? 'm trying to sleep."

Nightmare blinked. "You're... dreaming of sleeping, child?"

"...Yeah?" Hat Kid yawned. "...sleeping's the best."

Dream surprised himself by bursting into laughter. "Oh, I like this kid."
