### A Dream of Dream

After meeting all the strange versions of Sans - especially those more murdery ones - Mustache Girl expected a rougher sleep.

And yet, she couldn't complain about remembering what Seaside *used* to be like. 

It was a quiet night on the docks of Seaside. The kind of night she always missed when the Mafia arrived - when the island town was sleepy, barely anyone around, and she and her old man would walk down to watch the sun set over the distant ocean horizon. He would set the fishing line, and she would keep him company while they both ate from their bag of hot fish and chips from the nearby takeaway.

Mu smiled to herself and watched the fishing boats in the distance. Pop must have gone to get their hot chocolates from the cafe, something else they would normally enjoy out here. It's a shame Hattie never got to experience this side of Seaside...

"Here you are." Right on cue, a steaming mug was held in front of her.

"Aw, thanks Pops," Mu beamed, reaching to take the mug from--

She paused.

...from the skeletal hand in front of her.

She took the mug, her eyes following the appendage, up the arm, to yet another version of Sans.

This one seemed fairly relaxed, beaming down at her in greeting. The first thing she noticed was his whole... whatever his 'bright yellow' palette thing was about. The only thing about him that wasn't was a light blue polo, complementing and contrasting with his boots and the cape wrapped around his shoulders. Even his eyes were the same kind of yellow.

It was the golden headpiece he adorned that gave her the best clue to who this actually was, though. She chuckled, finally bringing the cup toward herself. "The gold's a little on the nose, don't you think?"

The skeleton was self-aware enough to at least chuckle sheepishly, phalanges scraping at the back of his skull. "It wouldn't quite be me without it," he admitted. He nodded at the space next to Mu. "Mind if I take a seat?"

"I *guess*." Mustache Girl rolled her eyes. The sudden appearance of this skeleton, out of place in her memory, made it clear what was happening. "So I suppose I'm dreaming then."

"Yup." The skeleton chuckled once more as he shifted into a seated position, letting his legs dangle off the pier. Mu watched him look around at the world around him.

Then it hit her.

"...*Ohhhh*, *you're* Dream," she realised aloud. "Because I'm *dreaming*."

Dream couldn't help a giggle. "Yup! Nice to meet you. Mind you, I don't *only* exist in the dreamscape."

Mu nodded. "I didn't think so. I mean, we saw the-- uh, what was left of the other one."

"You mean my brother?" He raised a brow bone.

"Nightmare's your broth-- oh. Right. Yeah. Dream and Nightmare. That makes sense." She shook her head with a chuckle, and sipped from her hot chocolate. It still tasted just as she remembered, just as magical as it felt all those years ago. Thoughts of a simpler time swirled through her mind.

Thankfully Dream let her enjoy the moment, looking around him at Seaside, still curious about the world she dreamed of.

Mustache Girl finished a particularly long sip. "I thought- Okay, forgive me for being blunt, it's just... who I am - the loud blue one said you died."

"In a sense, yes." He sighed. "Quite... annoying, I must be honest. But I still somewhat exist, as you can see! Even if I no longer have a physical body..."

"Are we on the right track, then? Was it Moonjumper that did... this?" She gestured at his body.

"Oh, I was always able to visit dreams," Dream shrugged. "But yes... At least, I assume this 'Moonjumper' and the odd glitching character in the red suit that murdered me are the same."

Mu nodded. "Sounds like him. 's... why we're here and all that." She blinked. "Is... Nightmare also visiting us?"

"I don't sense him *here*," the skeleton replied quickly. "But considering the problem I would not be surprised if he was making contact with one of your friends. I do apologise for tha--"

Mu held up a hand to stop him, and Dream startled into silence, surprised by the action. "Look, no offence, I don't need to know the backstory between you two. If we don't do something though, your killer will undo the entire multiverse. And not just this... cluster of alternative universes or whatever's going on."

"... What about the nightmare thing?" He asked sheepishly.

"Snatcher or Hattie? They'll be fine," she waved off his concerns. 

----

"Alright Moony, wherever you are, you utter *pile*," Snatcher grumbled as he floated through the frozen, silent Subcon Forest - a version he'd worried about when Vanessa became more of a 'problem'. "You and I *both* know I don't sleep anymore. I'm a friggin' ghost for Pete's sake! So come on out and let me rip the *shit* out of you!" 

His magic flared inside him, the urge to strike something hot in his mind... even if he was currently in what was apparently a magically-induced sleep. 

But there was nothing to take it out on. His minions, the dwellers, not even any Mafia simpletons stumbling their way through. 

... Although...

He felt a pull, a draw, from the other side of the Village - where his magical laboratory stood.

Something was waiting for him there. 

Well, if *that* was how it was going to be... He slid silently into the shadows, moving effortlessly under the surface toward his target. 

And then, once he felt as though he were right underneath his prey, he burst out from the ground laughing--

And something slimy and acidic immediately wrapped itself around Snatcher's neck, pulling and redirecting his trajectory such that he was slammed firmly into the floor of his lab.

"A laudable attempt, Snatcher. Unfortunately, one's thoughts and intents are not quite as private as you would expect, in the dreamscape."

The ghost grumbled as the stranger's appendage retracted from him, and he turned his head to face his opponent - only to frown in confusion. 

It was another skeleton, though one he had not seen yet. This one wore a black turtleneck sweater and formal dress pants, and a mass of black, oily sludge that seemed to coalesce around his back... where four tentacles(?) sprouted, made of the same substance, currently aimed at him. The cyan eyes that watched him were calm, perhaps amused.

Now upright, Snatcher crossed his arms in front of him. "You look like something that came up out of the swamp. Just how many of you skeletons are there?"

The skeleton's grin compressed into a smirk. "I am something *more* than my peers. Borne to balance out the ideals of this multiverse. Some believe our war to be one of 'good versus evil' and other such simplifications, and that the only acceptable outcome for one side is the complete and total annihilation of the other. However--"

"All I know is, that you must be Nightmare," Snatcher cut him off. He smirked as well. "Look, I love a good villain monologue as much as the next guy. What I don't love is being asleep to receive it and therefore being defenseless. Considering you're dead and we're speaking, what you have to say must be important to us. To me. And considering Moonjumper was detected around your... what'd the kid call it - subverse? - I'm guessing that he's the one that killed you.
