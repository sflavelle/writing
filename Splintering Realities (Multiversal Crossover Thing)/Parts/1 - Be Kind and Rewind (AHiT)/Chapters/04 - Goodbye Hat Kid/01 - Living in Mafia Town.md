### Goodbye Hat Kid...

There were several things that Alex was learning from their time in the world,
after a day of living around the Mafia and the few non-Mafia citizens that
remained in the town.

One: 'The Mafia get what they want. If not peaceably, then through violence.'
Alex learned this the hard way when their phone was stolen as they were taking
photos of the town. Some random Mafia goon had taken interest in the device
and simply pinched it from their hands to toy with. They only found it later
in a trash bin once the goon had left it for long enough to lock himself out.

Two: 'Mafia will only support other Mafia.' As the sun set on their first day,
Alex had decided to head down to the docks to sightsee and enjoy the local
cuisine at Seaside Spaghetti, the town's only restaurant. It would have been
relaxing to sit at the edge of the docks and watch the sun retreat beneath the
ocean waves as they ate.

It would have been nice.

They were denied entrance *immediately* to the restaurant without so much as
an ID check or 'hello'. No, 'only mafia allowed to eat here', the doorman Mafia
had said as he shoved Alex away, knocking them onto the ground. Alex had grumbled
and called out to him, "Where am I supposed to eat then?!", only for him to
shrug and turn away.

Alex couldn't even sit on the end of the docks in peace. They had walked away
and found a quieter dock further down the bay, only to be harassed by a
different mafia goon declaring that the dock was his property, and to leave.

"Come on, man," Alex had begged. "I'm not bothering anyone here. Just let me
hang out on the edge here for a while."

But the goon was having none of it, and as they turned back to the sea, they
were struck in the back of the head by a sucker punch.

Which led to the Third Thing: she was still living by the laws (and physics)
of her own world.

The cowardly punch had knocked her out, and she had dropped into the water,
quickly drowning as the goon had returned back to his work.

...

And then Alex was awake again, staring up at the hole in the tarp, on the
garbage pile in the streets above. The same way she had woken up that morning.

They confusedly stumbled over to the bridge nearby to peer down at the docks as
a small group of Mafia fished out their drowned body.

Alex avoided the docks after that.

Clearly she'd died, and then respawned. Right? That didn't feel correct. She felt
exactly as she had felt when coming to, earlier in the day, but time was clearly
still passing, and it was now growing dark.

At least 'rewinding' or whatever had occurred to them had made them less hungry.

So, Four: 'I can't *quite* die, but if I do, I'll end up back under the tarp.'

But Alex was not interested in just sleeping on the streets.

And so they decided that if this was how things were going to be, they were going
to need to practice squatters rights.

Which meant, hopefully, finding a house or building here that had been abandoned.

They were at least hopeful about this.
