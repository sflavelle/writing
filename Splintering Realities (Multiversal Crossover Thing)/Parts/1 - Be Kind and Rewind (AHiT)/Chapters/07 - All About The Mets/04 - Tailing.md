By the time the train had burst out from the confined tunnels into the open air of the central Metro hub, Mu and Hat Kid's plan was in place.

Hiding atop the carriages, Mustache Girl had lent Hattie her red tunic, and was wearing a tank top and shorts that she wore underneath, her blonde hair out in the open. She felt uncomfortable without it on, but seeing that her companion was much more relaxed now, not having to worry about her distinct appearance, had her deciding that the inconvenience was worth it this time.

The giant kitten pulling its train slowed as its passenger carriages slid neatly into the station. The kids watched as a crowd of cats exited the train, and among them, a human girl a few carriages down from them.

Alex.

They climbed down from the roof of the carriages, sliding into the back of the crowd, blending in as Mu watched Alex walk up to the station map, trying to place where her next destination was.
