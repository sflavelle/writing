"WE RETURN, FRIENDS!" Papyrus declared as he, Sans, Frisk, Sans, Toriel, and two human kids walked in to the common room as if nothing was unusual.

The apartment complex's common room was furnished as little more than a big living area, with a connected kitchen, a table set aside for dining, and an ice hockey table in the corner. Sitting in various places on the extended lounge were Toriel, who was knitting; Alphys, currently in discussions with a young-looking humanoid creature next to her who looked like she had a squid on her head. There was also Flowey, situated in a pot next to... wait was that DJ Grooves and Mettaton?!

"Darlings!" Grooves called at the sight of Hat Kid and Mu, and Hattie gasped in delight, eyes wide as she rushed over to give the moon penguin a hug, earning an amused 'How adorable~' from the robot. Toriel looked up from her knitting needles, partially-made woollen scarf dangling as she took in the two new humans. "I am *so* happy to see you all in good shape in the midst of this mess. Yes, even you, red darlin~," he nodded at Mu, stood in the doorway as the skeletons moved in, Papyrus and Frisk carrying their shopping haul while Sans floated his behind him. "Y'all'll have to fill me in on what's been happening."

"We will, I promise," Hat Kid smiled at him. It became a grimace briefly as she added, "I'm sorry about Alex going missing. We're trying to find the guy who kidnapped her, but it's been tricky dealing with all this multiversal stuff he's been causing."

The penguin only smiled warmly at her, and pulled her into a hug. "I'm so proud of you, my little diva. I know you'll do your absolute best."

"Is this the young child you've told me so much about?" Toriel looked upon the scene with warmth in her eyes and a fond smile on her muzzle. "It is a pleasure to meet you, my children. You may call me Toriel, and these are our friends. You will be safe here," she added, raising a paw to her chest, where her heart would be.

"hey tori," Sans greeted casually from her right, and she turned in her seat to face the skeleton, with Frisk next to him. "the kid got a bit spooked earlier. i think they're doing better, but they could use some comfort this sack of bones just isn't equipped with." He let out a soft chuckle.

"Aww, my poor child." Toriel patted her lap, and adjusted herself on the seat as Frisk made themselves comfortable with their adoptive mom. "You didn't leave them all *bonely* on the street, did you?"

"ouch. of course not. throw me a bone here, tori."

"If you let them get hurt, I promise you'll be in a skele-*ton* of trouble." The warmth in her eyes was there, but there was a more serious edge to her voice that Sans immediately noticed.

She paused when he noticed the skeleton's deer-in-the-headlights expression. There was something he was not telling her. She heard Alphys, somewhere to her left, stutter out, "S-s-...Sans...?"

"hey there alphy. it's... it's good to see you again." Sans' voice was now coming from her left.

"W...why are there two of you?"

Toriel blinked her eyes, glancing over.

There was Sans, standing before Alphys with a look of... relief and joy on his face. When had he put that peculiar beanie on?

Sans made a coughing noise, to her right again. She turned and... there he was.

Wait.

She did a double-take. Turning toward Sans by Alphys, then back toward Sans beside her.

"...tori?" Sans, her Sans, spoke gently. "can we... get the others down here? there's a bit of a discussion that needs to be had."

"...Sans?" Both looked toward her, but she was focused on the one she knew. "What's going on?"

"look, uhh. you know some weird stuff has been going on with the portals, and lily, and everything. he... hasn't seen us for a while. give him some slack. they'll explain everything, but we should probably get everyone down here first."

Slowly, Toriel nodded. "Okay. I'm trusting you."

"i know." He ruffled Frisk's hair before backing away and leaving the common room.

After speaking to Alphys for a bit, Beanie Sans eyed the goat monster, seemed to take a breath, and carefully sat down next to her as she resumed her knitting, taking her in. Toriel felt a gentle, but concerning pull of apprehension. What was this Sans like? Why were there two of them? Was it something to do with the other human children, and that moon penguin, and the other weird things that have been happening?

"it's nice to see everyone. so... happy, so relaxed."

Toriel glanced toward him, noticed him fidgeting slightly, keeping his hands clasped together. Did her Sans do that too? She couldn't remember. "Have... things been tough?"

"heh. you could say that. it's been better since i ended up with the kids, but..." Sans sighed. "i do kinda miss the way things were, the old routine. not being in the underground, i mean. just how... domestic, how routine everything was in our lives." He looked up towards her. "...i missed hearing your voice, tori."

Toriel's knitting slowed, then stopped entirely. What had he been through? She noticed Alphys still watching him, even as the new children beckoned Frisk away to show them a strange device they had procured.

----

"Ladies and Gentle-monsters!" Hat Kid declared, standing next to Mustache Girl and Cooking Cat in front of the collective group that had gathered on and around the couch. All of Sans and Asgore's friend group were here, and both girls were amazed at the variety of the monsters - it was almost like being back on Mu's planet! There were goats, and skeletons, and flowers, and flames, and fish, and dinosaurs, and ghosts (wearing white sheets though, not the black/purple hoods Snatcher's lot wore), and robots (well, one robot)! And nestled in amongst them were DJ Grooves, and the young humanoid girl that looked like she had tentacles for hair. And none of them wanted to try and kill her!

Things were going well.

"You may call me Hat Kid, and this is my wonderful assistant Mu! We are travelers from the multiverse, and we are here before you today as chance had led us to reunite you with two people you may be familiar with! We will also take the opportunity to explain what is happening *to* the multiverse, and what you may be able to do to help."

Mu continued on. "The weird things that are happening, people from other realities showing up, is happening *everywhere* as a result of a being called the Moonjumper. They have set off a chain of events that is collapsing the multiverse into itself, causing these portals and oddities."

Hat Kid picked up the presentation from there. "We will explain more of that in a moment, but right now, to help us explain how this relates to you all, can I ask for, er, Sans and Asgore Dreemurr to come up please?"

The group applauded, turning their gaze to their King and the skeleton as they made a gesture to get up... only for another Sans and Asgore to walk in through the door behind the girls. There were gasps and hushed whispers among the crowd, and a few monsters eyeing the two among them warily. *Their* Sans and Asgore were relaxed however, as they had already met their counterpart before this presentation.

The two monsters on stage were both wearing some sort of headwear from Hattie's repertoire to differentiate themselves from the versions in this universe. Sans still wore the Ice Hat beanie, smiling his signature smile at the crowd while Asgore wore one of Hattie's patterned purple top hats as he bowed gently.

"Now, to explain how this has come to pass, we'd also like Frisk to come on up, and, uh - who was it you nominated again?"

Frisk leapt up from the couch and ran over to Alphys' seat, tugging her up and across. "This is Alphys! She's the royal scientist, and she's really smart!" They grinned.

"A-ah... in front of e-everyone? I-I-I don't know," they stuttered heavily, fighting the urge to bury her face in her hands.

"You can do it, sweetheart!" Undyne, who had been next to her called, as the crowd applauded.

Once Alphys had been coaxed up to the stage, Hat Kid began to explain, presenting the handheld device she had shown Frisk earlier. "This is what we're calling the Multiversal Divergence Point Detector. It can take one entity, and determine its origin universe, *or* in the case of two similar entities, find out where their realities diverged!"

As she demonstrated use of the device to the scientist, Tempus Sans spoke up. "the two of us are identical to the two of you," he eyed his counterpart, "up to a certain point, where our timelines diverged. now, we have already done a test, and talked with frisk here to figure out exactly where that divergence point happened..."

"But," Asgore continued softly, "in the interest of honesty, we have asked young Frisk to nominate someone from *this* reality to run the test a second time."

"O-okay, so I sample one, then the other?" Alphys had asked Hat Kid, who nodded. She then turned and nervously made her way up to her King Asgore. "M-may I, sir?"

"Previously we ran the test with Sans and his counterpart," Mu explained to the couch, "taking a sample of their temporal signatures. They shouldn't feel anything, but at the worst you might feel a tingle."

The crowd watched and made light chatter as Alphys and Hat Kid went through the DPD test, curious about these smart kids and these versions of their friends they brought along. But after a quiet minute, the device had finished processing the data it had, and what was shown on its screen made Alphys mutter, "O-oh my... are-are you sure this is correct?"

Taking a glance at the screen herself, Hat Kid nodded. "That's the same thing we got, so I think it's safe to say it's the truth. Frisk, would you be willing to explain to our friends?"

Frisk took a breath, nodding, looking nervous. "When... I first came to the underground, before I knew about... monsters and things, the very first monster I encountered was, ah, Flowey." Their eyes briefly flickered onto the sunflower-y monster, potted in the corner. "I was scared and didn't yet know that they were... the exception. So I thought that... that Toriel, when she saved me from Flowey, would hurt me too... but she didn't. And when she led me through the Ruins, I realised that I *didn't* have to fear her, that I... didn't have to fight like I initially fought."

As the monsters they knew smiled and cheered them on, they held up a hand to get them to calm down. They took a few long moments to choke out, still disgusted with the idea, "...it would have been so easy to let that fear get the better of me. T-to lash out. And... in... their reality... it did. And I..." They trailed off, unable to say the words. Tempus Sans rested a hand on their shoulder gently, and Frisk didn't delay in burying themselves in his jacket, letting the skeleton brush his digits through the kid's hair. 

"...fear is a powerful thing, just as much as the determination in their soul," Sans spoke for them. "and the thing about humans, and a lot of creatures, no matter what species, is... if they believe they've been cornered, and the only way to safety is through, well... you would be surprised what they're capable of. ...i harbor no ill feelings for frisk, the person. the actions of frisk here, in this reality, are a testament to the ability to keep an open mind and to not let fear control you. i'm glad, really, to have the opportunity to meet this frisk."

"So if their Frisk was pushed to hurt monsters, how many of their friends in that world are okay?" DJ Grooves asked.

"...well, there's asgore and myself," Tempus Sans began, counting on his fingers as if he were going to name more... but after the two, he paused after a few seconds, and then slowly he put his hands away, his grin shifting into more of a grimace.

The ripple of emotions and expressions through the group was clear as everyone realised what he meant - they were the only survivors. The group was surrounded in a warm embrace.
