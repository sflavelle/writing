## Coalescence

Cleanup efforts began as soon as the final tremors had settled, leaving the Underground in quite a state of disarray.

Trees had fallen. Paths were blocked. Flooding, cave-ins. The energy wave had really done a number on the place.

In Snowdin, guardsmen were in the process of checking in with residents and chipping away at rocks that blocked paths. Sans had been directed back to his sentry station by Papyrus, to watch for any activity from the Ruins.

Waterfall had seen the most damage. The Dump was blocked up with boulders, and rivers were displaced, causing some flooding, especially around the Blook Family Estate and Gerson's store. Personnel were being dispatched from New Home to assist, as it was clear Undyne the Undying, despite her strength, would not be able to clear all of this on her own.

Many had worried that the activity might cause Hotland to become even more dangerous, but it seemed much of the area was still structurally sound, if shaken up. The Lab was still mostly functional, though the basements would have to be checked over at some point. Alphys was not looking forward to that. Or re-ordering and re-creating several destroyed materials.

And in the Ruins, much was in disarray. Monsters that hid or kept to themselves were *everywhere*, trying to help each other stay safe. Hoping that Lady Toriel would help them.

Lady Toriel, who held the three children tight to her, a magical shield protecting them from the rocks that rained down around them.

When, finally, the tremors stopped and it seemed nothing would come down on their heads, Toriel released the spell and squeezed each child tightly. "Are you all alright?" She said in a soft voice.

Frisk sniffled and nodded. The child with the purple top hat and the one with the red hood let out a soft 'yeah'.

She breathed a sigh of relief. "I'm glad. We haven't had seismic activity for... about as long as I can remember!" She stepped back and stood, clearing her throat. "My name is Toriel, and I am the caretaker of these Ruins."

The child in purple smiled warmly. "Call me Hattie!" She beamed, and adjusted her tophat. She gestured to her friend. "This is Mu."
