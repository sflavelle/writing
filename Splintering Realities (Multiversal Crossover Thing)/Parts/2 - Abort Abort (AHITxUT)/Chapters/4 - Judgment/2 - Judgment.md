"there's just... one more thing that i'd like to discuss, then," Sans said, his tone shifting, indicating this was going to be somewhat uncomfortable. "before we decide on whether or not to stay."

"Sure," Hat Kid nodded, sitting up.

"i need to discuss your LV," he says bluntly. "both of you." Toriel let out a soft 'oh', and Frisk gasped, realising he was going to pass judgment on them - as they had done with them prior.

"LV...?" Mu cocked her head.

"it's a monster term," Sans explained. "it stands for 'level of violence'." He took a breath, and leaned in toward the two kids. "most humans and monsters are gonna have an LV of 1. that's great. LV 2 can happen as an accident, sometimes. but when i met you both, before frisk reset, there was something when I checked you then that concerned me. so, i'm going to run that check again. okay? i'll be totally transparent with it, since you've been fairly helpful so far. but i need you to help me understand it. are you ready?"

Mu and Hattie shared a look. "I... guess?" Hat Kid raised an eyebrow? "What does this 'check' invol--"

She stopped in her tracks the moment she felt her sins crawling on her back. Felt the weight of every decision she had ever made in one instnat.

Between her and Sans, the skeleton raised a palm, and a... text box appeared, floating above it.

```
* Haley Komett - LV 4 HP 4/4
* Her problems started the day she passed that planet.
* What she would give to go back to drawing faces on potatoes.
```

Hat Kid stared at the floating box, a fear on the edges of her expression. "...But... I don't understand. ...How can I have an LV, if I've haven't *done* anything violent in your universe?"

Sans took a deep breath, his eyesockets shutting. "doesn't matter, kid. there's only one way you gain LV."

"...And how's that?" she quietly asked him.

Frisk's sharp intake of breath earned them the attention of the other two kids. "...You've killed," they said, softly, tears in their eyes. "Not as much as... C-Chara, but more than is normal."

Mu and Hattie shared a look of horror. Mu was slightly skeptical. "There's... a normal amount of killing?" 

Sans, despite the serious subject, allowed a soft chuckle. "zero, ideally." He turned to Mustache Girl. "heads up."

```
* Mu - LV 1 HP 4/4
* She still doesn't quite understand how she's here alongside her.
* Judge, jury, executioner in one timeline, space/time adventurer in the next.
```

Mu gasped, the sudden weight of all her sins weighing her down in her chair. Suddenly she was reliving Time's End, the fight against the Mafia Boss, her subsequent liquefication of his body, all the world's inhabitants she sent to their fate...

The inhabitants of the planet, coming together to tell her to '*get lost*'.

She felt herself choking on her emotions, the hate, the fear, the horrible things she'd done. She was shocked into silence.

"...hm, okay. now i understand," Sans mused. "your LV is 1 because all that got undone, huh? but you still made those decisions. people still died."

He allowed them a moment to catch their breath. "now, my role as judge is more meant for the underground. y'know, determining who  should be allowed to see asgore n' such. but if we ride with you on this adventure, we *need to know* that our trust in you won't lead to our deaths.

"so, i ask one simple thing." Sans leaned back. "justify yourselves."
