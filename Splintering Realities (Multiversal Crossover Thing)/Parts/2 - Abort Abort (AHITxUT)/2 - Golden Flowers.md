## Golden Flowers

Mu was the first to wake, owing to her life as a light sleeper, what with the Mafia and all that.

And as soon as she couldn't place where she woke up, she was scrambling to her feet to get a look around.

Her emerging panic at being alone again halted as soon as she noticed Hat Kid nearby.

Her eyebrow raised as she then saw the other kid, slowly coming to, in the same bed of flowers as she and Hattie.

This bed was brightly lit - Mu looked upward, and found its light source somewhere up above, a hole in the rocky walls surrounding them.

Okay, so they were still underground...

She turned around, to this 'Frisk' character, who was now sat up, rubbing their head and breathing hard. They were facing away. Did they know they brought her and Hattie here...?
