Author Notes - Multiverse Compatibility

When visitors from one universe travel to another, they are (generally) subject to the laws governing that universe's physics and metaphysics. Most universes of a similar 'type' are compatible with each other, requiring no adjustment on the part of the visitor, but there are certain quirks of each universe that may come into effect. Additionally, a visitor from a universe that is 'too different' from the universe they are visiting may not be fully subject to the visited universe's laws without additional assistance.

A visitor from a 'Linear Time' universe to a 'Fluid Time' universe may encounter a situation where they are present in the universe they are visiting, but said universe has already passed off governance of the visitor back to their previous universe. In this state, they are present in two places - they appear to be present and interacting with the universe they are present in, but may actually also present in a place 'between' this universe and their previous universe.

Each universe listed is ranked on certain statistics:
Physics: Generally, how objects interact with each other. (scale: Damaged ... Simplified ... Semi-Realistic ... Realistic)
Time Flow: How does Time as a concept manifest? (scale: Linear ... Fluid (Forward/Backward/Stopped) ... Timey-Wimey)
Life Force: How healthiness/"life energy" is represented in the universe, and how injuries and 'damage' affect that life energy. Universes might sometimes treat 'life' and 'damage' separately on the scale. (scale: Cartoon-ish ... HP (numbers) ... HP (bars) ... Movie Logic ... Realistic)
Logic Basis: How events occur on a day-to-day basis. (scale: Chaotic ... Rule of Funny ... Contrived ... Luck ... Karma ... Natural)
Supernatural Force: The presence of a force or energy (magic, midichlorians, etc) allowing for power or abilities greater than a standard being. (scale: Devoid ... Dormant ... Superheroic (Chosen Few) ... Magical Society ... Commonplace)

Universe Listings:
------

"Reality" (The Real World):
Physics: Realistic
Time Flow: Linear
Life Force: Realistic
Logic Basis: Luck / Karma / Natural
Supernatural Force: Devoid
Quirks:
 - N/A

The Horizon / The Void:
Physics: Damaged
Time Flow: N/A
Life Force: Unknown
Logic Basis: Unknown
Supernatural Force: Devoid
Quirks:
 - The space between universes, made up of leftover pieces of discarded or destroyed universes. Time does not exist. Logic does not exist. Nothing should be alive here.
 - This is where Moonjumper originates from - his role in A Hat in Time was scrapped, and so the version of A Hat in Time that contained him was left to die here.
 - Also where Undertale's former royal scientist W.D. Gaster is trapped.

A Hat in Time:
Physics: Simplified
Time Flow: Fluid
Life Force: HP (numbers)
Logic Basis: Rule of Funny / Contrived (eg.: Conductor blowing up and replacing his Owl Express train like it's nothing)
Supernatural Force: Magical Society (eg. Subcon Forest residents, Hat Kid's hat powers)
Quirks:
 - In universes with HP that is generally higher on average (Undertale/Deltarune), AHIT visitors keep their HP values from their universe, but damage to them is capped to 1 (eg. in a theoretical UT encounter with Hat Kid, their HP is still 4, but any attack against them will only cost Hat Kid 1HP.)
 - Working with Time Rifts in other universes have the same effect on time as in AHIT. (Time stop, followed by a rewind to some moments before)

Undertale/Deltarune:
Physics: Semi-Realistic
Time Flow: Fluid
Life Force: HP (numbers)
Logic Basis: Natural (Sans: Rule of Funny) (Yes, Sans the Skeleton is bound by separate logic)
Supernatural Force: Magical Society (eg. Monsters)

Red Dwarf:
Physics: Realistic
Time Flow: Fluid
Life Force: Movie Logic
Logic Basis: Rule of Funny / Contrived
Supernatural Force: Dormant (there are several aliens and societies that are technologically advanced enough that things they do might be SEEN as magic... then there are one-off monsters like the emotion-feeding, transforming Emohawk)
