It had been a social media post, reshared as a screenshot to another social media site, screenshotted from *that* site onto a Postodon feed that had led to this moment.

An InstaPix post by user *TheoUnderStars*, depicting a woman with red hair and mountain climbing gear, beaming as she stood in front of a wooden cabin, a snowy mountain looming over the scene. Beneath it was the caption, "*Proud of my bestie Maddy opening her brand new Celeste Tours business! Met her on this same mountain 6 years ago and there's no one that knows Mt Celeste inside and out better than her! Check it out at TourMtCeleste.ca.biz #mtceleste #besties #photoggers*".

Beneath it were more photos, seemingly of places on the mountain that were part of the trek, that caught his eye.
