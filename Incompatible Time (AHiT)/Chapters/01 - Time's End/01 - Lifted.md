## At The End of Time

Hat Kid grumbled to herself as she climbed the final staircase, the Castle towering over her.

She really didn't have time for this.

Well, actually now she had *all the time in the world* to deal with this new problem.

Same as the person who had shaped this castle into being - only less literally.

In her case, it was because this new development had quite literally wiped any other time wasters off the map. With her ship gone dark without Time Pieces (again), and the rest of the planet consumed by lava, this was the *only* thing she could do.

But as she paused, psyching herself up for whatever lay ahead, she realised something was missing.

The feeling of being watched, monitored... was gone for the first time since she had made it to this planet.

It was strange - even when she was all alone and *knew* nobody was around, that feeling had always been with her. She wished she could figure out what it had been, but, well, *this* was kind of a priority now.

A gust of hot wind blew past her, and she shook her head, refocusing herself. Hat Kid decided that while she'd *like* to know the answer, so long as the feeling didn't follow her once she departed from Earth, she was totally fine just letting it be yet another mystery of this wild planet.

She took a deep breath and strode for the double doors into the castle.
