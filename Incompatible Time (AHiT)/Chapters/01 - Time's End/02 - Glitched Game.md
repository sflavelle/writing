Alex stared at their screen, tapping the 'A' button on their controller in attempts to skip whatever weird cutscene was happening right now.

When they had loaded into The Finale, it had been a while since they had first played the level, but they didn't remember this extended, unskippable cutscene where they watched, from somewhere around the door to a throne room, as Mustache Girl 'judged'.

A cutscene when Hat Kid approached the throne room? Yeah, that sounded familiar. But not... whatever this was.

A third Mafia goon plummeted to his fate via floor trap.

"Yes, game, I get it, please get on with the level," Alex muttered.

Moustache Girl halted the Subcon Minion who was entering the room, scanning the room. "What did you say?" She snarled when nothing showed up, out of the ordinary.

"I didn't say anything!" The Minion spoke, trembling in its little puppet body. "I-I think I heard something though!"

"Hhhmm..." She wasn't so sure. Her hand slowly reached for the pull-chain that triggered the floor trap.

"Oh this is new. What's going on now?"

There it was again. And with it came a feeling she hadn't felt for a while, but which she could recognise.

Something was watching her.

She once thought this particular 'something' she had gained a sense for was attributable to that brat Hat Kid - it was something she quickly recognised as a second presence whenever she was around. She thought it was just a weird alien thing.

But then she had felt it when she had broken into the alien's ship - even though Hat Kid was nowhere to be seen, this feeling was stronger than ever, as if she had caught the attention of something...

And now it was somewhere in this room.

"That sounded like it was somewhere near me," offered the Minion, glancing around. "I can't see it, though..."

Moustache Girl thought. She rose from her throne and descended the pile of Time Pieces. She gestured for quiet as she listened for this intruder.

"Huh, doesn't she only come down when I go to attack her?"

*When you try to what?* This mystery voice was near the door, somewhere just left of the minion. She approached him, focusing her vision on him as she got close, stopping just in front of him. She didn't want this strange presence to know she was searching for him.

She and the minion stood in uncomfortable silence as they stared at each other for a long moment.

She thought she saw a light reflection, off a near invisible panel of glass that should not have been there. Floating off the ground. Was that...?

"Uhhh," vocalised the minion.

"Yeah guy, what is this cutscene now? Am I softlocked?"

That voice definitely came from the panel. It seemed to become more visible as she watched out of the corner of her vision.

Moustache Girl reached toward the minion...

Then feinted left and dove for the panel, grabbing it in both hands. "Aha! Gotcha!"

The panel burst into colour as she touched it, and she found herself looking at a person, captured on screen as if on one of those sci-fi communications devices on tv. "Who *are* you, you stalker?! Who are you to come in here and spy on ME?"

In response, the person on the other side of the screen tried once again to press buttons on their controller in an attempt to skip the cutscene.

"Oi! I'm talking to *you* in there, *nerd!*" She tapped at the screen toward the person as she said this, only for her pointed finger to hit nothing. Indeed, it seemed almost to pass through.

"Yeah hi," said the person dismissively. "Can I please play the game now?"

This gave Mu an idea.

"Yeah, I got a game, it's called *Judge-*" She thrust her hand into the screen, reaching in to grab the person's clothes.

"Jury-" she pulled as hard as she could, hearing things knock over as the person's head appeared through the screen.

"And Executioner!" With a particularly strong tug their body was pulled completely through, and the person fell with a thump onto the floor of the throne room. The minion jumped back as this third person seemed to appear out of thin air. Mu noticed this person was about a third taller than her.

Everyone was quiet for a few moments.

The body on the floor, briefly still, began to move again, as they lifted their head up. "Oughhh... what the fuck..."

They raised a hand to cup their forehead... and Mu watched them notice the red floor. Their eyes opened wide. "What the fuck?"

And then finally, they pushed themselves up onto their knees, looking around, before their glance fell on her.

Their jaw dropped.

A few seconds passed.

Then the person jumped back onto their feet, backing away with an expression of fear plastered on their face. "What the *fuck*?! W-what did you DO?!"

The minion forgotten, Mu approached this strange human-like figure. "You've been watching us all this whole time, haven't you?! With *her*!"

"What?!" 

"Don't 'what' me!" She launched toward them and swung a punch hard into their stomach, causing them to double over. "I've felt your presence around *her* and her ship ever since you both arrived in Mafia Town!"

The punch expelled the air from their lungs, and they clutched at their stomach as they choked in some of the hot ambient air. "T-that's... not possible!"

"Oh, so you thought you were *invisible*? *Undetectable*? *Invulnerable*, even?" She grabbed at their hair and yanked their head down, driving her knee upward to connect into their face.

The impact sent them reeling back, and they stumbled and fell backward onto their back, head smacking against the floor. They were stunned and unable to retaliate as Mu began to drag them back toward the middle of the room.

Toward the floor trap.

"You saw *everything* that was going on in this world, and you chose to *watch* from the safety of your... whereever you were. Didn't bother to step in and help. Even when you were following *her*, you just let her do all the work."

Mustache Girl dropped them, sprawled out, in the middle of the floor that would give out and doom them to a death by lava. As the intruder shook their head, trying to get some sense back into them, now sporting a bruise on their cheek and a bloody nose, she turned toward them, on her way back up to her throne - and the pull-chain that would condemn them - and said, "I've no doubt you're a *bad guy*. And you know what we do to bad guys in this house?"

"Hey," spoke the Subcon Minion, who to this point had been content to be ignored. "What if they *couldn't* help? It's not like they ever slighted you!"

Mu paused. "You're one to talk. You ally yourself with evil spirits! *They* at least could have done something meaningful! But no, I guess this is all just a *game* to them."

"You have no idea," the intruder croaked.

"Oh, *shut it*, you." Mu climbed the mountain of Time Pieces, and she picked one up and pelted it toward them. The wood frame smacked them on the noggin, and they collapsed to the ground, unconscious.

The Time Piece, undamaged, bounced onto its side and rolled away.

Mu watched it for just a second, before continuing her climb.

And it was then that the giant doors burst open.

Mu and the Minion turned.

It was the kid in the hat, umbrella at the ready.
