The battle at the end of Time had been long and hard-fought.

Hat Kid had known Time to change people, sure. But whatever it had done to Mustache Girl was on another level entirely. It was as if the power that the people of this planet *thought* the Time Pieces would give them, had manifested in Mu. 

Reshaping reality was not a known side-effect of wielding Time, after all. Then again, people didn't normally wield *this much* Time.

But as she stood over Mu's unconscious body, back in the throne room, she wondered briefly where the people who had come to her aid had gone. Surely they should have popped out of... Time with her?

She considered that they had been trapped in whatever pocket of Time that Mu had wrenched open, and when it collapsed, when Mu's power had exhausted, they had... ceased to be.

Well, good thing she had won. And the floating ball of Time Pieces lay just beyond, waiting for her to take hold and fix this whole wretched mess.

She would put things back as they were, hopefully rewind things to before she even arrived on the planet. And then, with the Time Piece fuel all within her possession again, she would continue her journey back home and have the planet nonethewiser that she was even there.

She let out a sigh, and slowly stepped toward the Time Piece ball.

It was a real shame though. She did so many fun and crazy things here. She got to be a movie star, beat up a ghost, solve a murder, fix a few time rifts, deliver mail, scare a man, swing through mountains...

It had been a nice change from the rather low-key life she had been living in her spaceship, up to that point.

But, she reasoned, it shouldn't have happened in the first place. 

At least she'd still have the memories of this adventure.

With that, she smiled.

*Okay, time to focus.*

As she took hold of the ball of Time Pieces, she thought hard on how she had remembered the planet looking. Its people, its landscape, the places... its timeline as it had once been, before it had been corrupted into... this.

Once she was confident things will repair the way she intended, she took a deep breath...

And smashed the Time Pieces into the ground.

There was a flash of white and a roar of sound and then-
