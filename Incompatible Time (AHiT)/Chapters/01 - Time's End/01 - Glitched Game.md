Alex stared at their screen, tapping the 'A' button on their controller in attempts to skip whatever weird cutscene was happening right now.

When they had loaded into The Finale, it had been a while since they had first played the level, but they didn't remember this extended, unskippable cutscene where they watched, from somewhere around the door to a throne room, as Mustache Girl 'judged'.

A cutscene when Hat Kid approached the throne room? Yeah, that sounded familiar. But not... whatever this was.

A third Mafia goon plummeted to his fate via floor trap.

"Yes, game, I get it, please get on with the level," Alex muttered.

Moustache Girl halted the Subcon Minion who was entering the room, scanning the room. "What did you say?" She snarled when nothing showed up, out of the ordinary.

"I didn't say anything!" The Minion spoke, trembling in its little puppet body. "I-I think I heard something though!"

"Hhhmm..." She wasn't so sure. Her hand slowly reached for the pull-chain that triggered the floor trap.

"Oh this is new. What's going on now?"

There it was again. And with it came a feeling she hadn't felt for a while, but which she could recognise.

Something was watching her.

She once thought this particular 'something' she had gained a sense for was attributable to that brat Hat Kid - it was something she quickly recognised as a second presence whenever she was around. She thought it was just a weird alien thing.

But then she had felt it when she had broken into the alien's ship - even though Hat Kid was nowhere to be seen, this feeling was stronger than ever, as if she had caught the attention of something...

And now it was somewhere in this room.

"That sounded like it was somewhere near me," offered the Minion, glancing around. "I can't see it, though..."

Moustache Girl thought. She rose from her throne and descended the pile of Time Pieces. She gestured for quiet as she listened for this intruder.

"Huh, doesn't she only come down when I go to attack her?"

*When you try to what?* This mystery voice was near the door, somewhere just left of the minion. She approached him, focusing her vision on him as she got close, stopping just in front of him. She didn't want this strange presence to know she was searching for him.

She and the minion stood in uncomfortable silence as they stared at each other.

She thought she saw a light reflection, off a near invisible panel of glass that should not have been there. Floating off the ground. Was that...?

"Uhhh," vocalised the minion.

"Yeah guy, what is this cutscene now? Am I softlocked?"

That voice definitely came from the panel. It seemed to become more visible as she watched out of the corner of her vision.

Moustache Girl reached toward the minion...

Then feinted left and dove for the panel, grabbing it in both hands. "Aha! Gotcha!"

The panel burst into colour as she touched it, and she found herself looking at a person, captured on screen as if on one of those sci-fi communications devices on tv. "Who *are* you, you stalker?! Who are you to come in here and spy on ME?"

In response, the person on the other side of the screen tried once again to press buttons on their controller in an attempt to skip the cutscene.

"Oi! I'm talking to *you* in there, *nerd!*" She tapped at the screen toward the person as she said this, only for her pointed finger to hit nothing. Indeed, it seemed almost to pass through.

"Yeah hi," said the person dismissively. "Can I please play the game now?"

This gave Mu an idea.

"Yeah, I got a game, it's called *Judge-*" She thrust her hand into the screen, reaching in to grab the person's clothes.

"Jury-" she pulled as hard as she could, hearing things knock over as the person's head appeared through the screen.

"And Executioner!" With a particularly strong tug their body was pulled completely through, and the person fell with a thump onto the floor of the throne room. The minion jumped back as this third person seemed to appear out of thin air.
