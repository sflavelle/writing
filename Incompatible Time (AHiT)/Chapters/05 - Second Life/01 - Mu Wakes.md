It was a cold evening in Mafia Town when Mustache Girl finally stirred.

Even after the few days she had spent unconscious, her being ached, fatigued and drained. Had she come down with a cold? Figures.

Blearily opening her eyes, she was greeted with flickering light cast upon the ceiling of what she recognised as her camp. In the corner of her vision she saw its source - her campfire was lit.

Oh this was not good. 

Mu struggled to sit up, nearly falling right back into sleep.

"Hey. Relax. You've been through a lot."

She froze. Blinking her eyes into focus, she saw that she indeed had a visitor.

It was that damn Hat Kid. And looking at herself, it seemed the alien had brought a pillow and spare blanket for Mu. But... why?

Mu sighed and flopped back under the blanket she had been given. "...Come to rub it in, huh."

"Not really. How ya feeling?"

"Like shi--peck." She yawned, blinking her eyes a few times.

"Sorry."

"Not you, I think. Musta... picked up a cold or something while I was down. How long was I...?"

When Hat Kid didn't immediately respond, Mu glanced over at her, and saw her in thought. "Uhh, kid? How long?"

"...Well," Hat Kid began taking out a pocket watch and glancing at it. "I think it's been three full days since we fought."

"You mean to tell me I've slept for *three days*?!"

"I guess so. Don't ask me, I've only been here with you for a few hours. But uh, you know how we're back in Mafia Town?"

Mu grumbled in response.

"Well, things have kinda been rewound and set back to normal, and well, I think it's about... two weeks since we first met. Filming just wrapped at that bird studio."

"Oh. So it's like... It never happened, right? Nobody else remembers?"

"Uhh... You're not going to like the answer."

"Ah, fu-... they all remember, don't they."

"..." Hat Kid sighed. "Not *all*, but... you kinda painted a target on your head, yeah."

Mu was silent as this sank in. Now this world full of bad guys was gonna be on the lookout for her specifically. Oh that... That felt *incredibly* crushing to know.

"Look, uh... for what it's worth, I didn't intend for anyone to remember. So for what it's worth, um... sorry. I don't know what I did wrong."

She sighed and sank deeper into the blanket. "Whatever. I guess I deserve it for being the only good guy, huh?"

Hat Kid didn't respond immediately. She leaned back against the cove wall. Taking a moment to gather her thoughts, she responded, "I don't think you deserve all of it, no."

Mu glanced over at her, raising an eyebrow. "How can you *say* that?"

"I mean... I'm going to guess you didn't mean to turn the planet into lava, right?"

"Of course not! I mean... yeah, it ferried everyone to my courtroom of judgment, but..."

"It's just one of the possible consequences of messing with time. So many changes can really mess with the planet's structure. But you figured it out, right? It's not the foolproof way to fix the island that you wanted."

"Yeah. Yeah, I think you beat that into me."

"So learned your lesson. You got access to a power you shouldn't have had, it went wrong, and you regret it. You deserve a second chance to do your thing. Without the consequences of the first attempt."

"...So... You *want* me to do it right this time? Get your story straight, kid."

"No, what I mean is..." Thinking for a moment to explain what she meant, Hat Kid shuffled from her spot opposite the campfire from Mu, closer to her side. "This all started with you wanting to remove the Mafia from the island, right?"

"Well, yeah. They ruined my hometown. I'll never forgive them for that."

"Right. But it might still be possible, even if you don't have the Time Pieces anymore. Look, I have... a bit of insider information." From a backpack she had brought with her, she retrieved a book - the storybook from the Mafia Boss's time rift. "The Mafia only settled here because they were fleeing a more boring situation, and this place is like a vacation to them. If I had to suggest an idea... I would find somewhere the Mafia might find better than this, and try to get them to move *there*."

Mu pinched the book from the Kid's hands, and flipped through it. "Sure, but trust me, these guys are stubborn. Couldn't I like... go back in time before they even left wherever awful place Mafia come from, with that better place, and tell them to go there instead? Even if they're bad guys, that wouldn't hurt them, right?"

"...Sorry, Mu. I like the idea, but we've both messed with time enough, and I can't spare a Time Piece, or I won't be able to get home." Hat Kid shook her head.

"Hmm? What do you mean, you won't get home without them?"

"They're spaceship fuel."

"No they're not."

"It's true!"

"How can *time* be a fuel?!" Mu sat up, pinching the bridge of her nose, and Hat Kid got a good look at her drowsy, cold-addled expression.

"I can't really explain that. Trade secret."

"Pfeh. Whatever, kid. How far away is home, anyway?"

"About five light years away from here."

"Light... *years*?" 

"Uhh... light travels really, *really* fast, right?"

"Yeah...?"

"Imagine travelling that fast for five years straight. Out of the solar system, maybe into another galaxy."

"What the hell? You aliens are freaky."

"Thanks." Hat Kid stuck her tongue out.

"But... okay, I guess I get why you were so set on getting them back."

Hat Kid nodded. "But, I can maybe offer something else for you." She took a moment to think it through, then gave a soft smile. "I know this place has been rough to you, and while I think you can be rough around the edges... for me, anyway," she added, raising her hands in apology. "... You deserve a better life than you've had so far. You've had to fight for the better part of your life, Mu, and you deserve at least an alternative. I think you once wanted to be space adventurers together?"

"I think I remember saying 'time-travelling crime fighters'. But space adventuring sounds cool too. I'm guessing the 'time-travelling' part is off the table?"

"Duh. How attached do you feel to this planet?"

Mu stared at her, jaw dropping. In another timeline, they'd beaten each other up at the end of Time itself - and now this kid was willing to just let it go and be friends again?

What did she do to earn this?

"...I..." Mu opened and closed her mouth a couple times. "... Wait, you're joking, right? People just don't *do* things like that."

"People *here* don't do things like that."

"True. Uhh... well... The thing is... like... Seaside is my home... or was."

"Seaside?"

"I *refuse* to call it Mafia Town." She spat off into the distance. "But over the years, anyone who... who might have once called me family, or even just a friend, has taken off. I once had a roof over my head, a home, I didn't have to steal food..."

Mu sighed, and looked down into her lap. "Seaside is a shell of what it once was. It's only gotten worse since the Mafia have taken over. And I can't really go anywhere else. That bird country won't accept non-bird migrants, Subcon is... well you know, and I may be pretty outspoken, but I don't have the lung capacity for the Alps." Glancing up to Hat Kid's face, she deeply sighed. "And even if I could go to those places, well ... as you said, I've made a lot of enemies now. So please... if this is a joke, just... just say so."

Hat Kid shook her head. "Not a joke. But, take your time and figure out what you want to do. I have a bit of time while I'm looking for someone."

Mu slowly nodded. "...Okay. You're alright, kid."

The other simply smiled. "Actually, I do need to ask you about them..."

Mustache Girl raised an eyebrow. "Who's this?"

"Well, from what I heard you managed to summon someone. Nobody knows who they are, and they're still running around here in Maf-- ...*Seaside*."

Mu let her lips curl up into a small smile at the Kid's usage of the town name. But was confused as to who she meant. "Summon? I didn't summon any--"

Suddenly her eyes snapped open as she realised who she might have meant. "WAIT, *that* guy? I thought he was stalking me for *you*!"

"What? No! Stalking?"

"Yeah! I always got that feeling of being watched around you, or that time I made it onto your ship! And it happened again in that throne room, and this time I found a guy hidden in some portal!"

"You *what*?" Hat Kid's mouth dropped open slightly, and Mu could almost see the gears turning in her head. "I... I've had that same feeling ever since I arrived here. And this person was just watching us the whole time?"

"Oh gosh, yeah. Sounds like it..."

"...Are they here now? I don't... feel it."

"No, me neither. Besides, I pulled them out of whatever thing made them invisible, and they seemed to be just... some guy." Mu glanced over at Hat Kid. "So you... rewinding time didn't send them home then?"

"It seems that way, yeah."

"...*Can* they be sent back?"

Hat Kid sighed. "I... don't know, but I don't think so. Unless we could find whatever thing they came through, but... you said it was invisible? And whoeven knows if that portal exists anymore."

Mu frowned. "So what do we do then?"

"Well... why don't we find them and keep an eye on them for a while?"

"Mm! And, let's make sure they don't cause any mischief now that they're free. I may need to find a jar, just in case."

"No jars." Hat Kid shook her head sternly.

"Why not?!"

"Surely they can't be worse than the Mafia for you. Also, spending the next few weeks with the Mafia Boss in a jar on my spaceship really turned me off the idea."

"Aww, I thought you *liked* my 'gift'!"

"I didn't mind the *company*. I did mind the fact he was a mess of eyes and brain matter in a pool of his own liquefied flesh." Hat Kid shuddered at the thought. "If they end up being bad, we'll find a way to restrain them."

Mu huffed. "Fiiiine. We'll do it your way."

"Thanks. Here." Hat Kid pulled something new from the backpack - it looked to be a lunch box of some kind. "Cooking Cat schmoozed up to me with a bunch of food. I thought I'd pack some for you. So you wouldn't have to go stealing anything."

Mustache Girl eyed the box suspiciously. "... What's the catch?"

"No catch?" The kid raised an eyebrow.

"Nah, there's a condition on getting this stuff. I know it."

She shook her head, and carefully set it on Mu's lap. "Tell you what. If you see this guy tomorrow, and I'm not there? I'll get you one of my ship's distress signal boxes. Just flick that on, and I'll know to come find you."

Mu eyed her suspiciously for a few seconds, then nodded, and opened up the box, and was met with the look and smell of delicious food... even some cooked stuff! She stared at the meal in wonder, and her empty stomach promptly growled. "You know, you might be a bad guy, *and* a good guy. But you know what? You really do seem to care..."

"I'm a bad guy still?" Hat Kid tilted her head.

"I mean, you did side with the other bad guys. And we did fight."

"Heh. I guess." She wondered if she would need to show Mustache Girl that life wasn't just black and white. She *got* why she had to think that way but... well, if they were going to work together, maybe it was worth tearing off a few rhetorical bandaids.

For now though, she stood. "Well, I'll let you be. Enjoy your meal. I'll come by in the morning and drop off the signal device, and maybe we can find this guy."

Mu nodded. "Sounds like a plan, kid."
