It was a cold evening in Mafia Town when Mustache Girl finally stirred.

Even after the few days she had spent unconscious, her being ached, fatigued and drained. Had she come down with a cold? Figures.

Blearily opening her eyes, she was greeted with flickering light cast upon the ceiling of what she recognised as her camp. In the corner of her vision she saw its source - her campfire was lit.

Oh this was not good. 

Mu struggled to sit up, nearly falling right back into sleep.

"Hey. Relax. You've been through a lot."

She froze. Blinking her eyes into focus, she saw that she indeed had a visitor.

It was that damn Hat Kid. And looking at herself, it seemed the alien had brought a pillow and spare blanket for Mu. But... why?

Mu sighed and flopped back under the blanket she had been given. "...Come to rub it in, huh."

"Not really. How ya feeling?"

"Like shi--peck." She yawned, blinking her eyes a few times.

"Sorry."

"Not you, I think. Musta... picked up a cold or something while I was down. How long was I...?"

When Hat Kid didn't immediately respond, Mu glanced over at her, and saw her in thought. "Uhh, kid? How long?"

"...Well," Hat Kid began taking out a pocket watch and glancing at it. "I think it's been three full days since we fought."

"You mean to tell me I've slept for *three days*?!"

"I guess so. Don't ask me, I've only been here with you for a few hours. But uh, you know how we're back in Mafia Town?"

Mu grumbled in response.

"Well, things have kinda been rewound and set back to normal, and well, I think it's about... two weeks since we first met. Filming just wrapped at that bird studio."

"Oh. So it's like... It never happened, right?"

"Uhh... You're not going to like the answer."

"Ah, fu-... they all remember, don't they."

"..." Hat Kid sighed. "Not *all*, but... you kinda painted a target on your head, yeah."

Mu was silent as this sank in. Now this world full of bad guys was gonna be on the lookout for her specifically. Oh that... That felt *incredibly* crushing to know.

"Look, uh... for what it's worth, I didn't intend for anyone to remember. So for what it's worth, um... sorry. I don't know what I did wrong."

She sighed and sank deeper into the blanket. "Whatever. I guess I deserve it, huh?"

Hat Kid didn't respond immediately. She leaned back against the cove wall. Taking a moment to gather her thoughts, she responded, "I don't think you deserve all of it, no."

Mu glanced over at her, raising an eyebrow. "How can you *say* that?"

"I mean... I'm going to guess you didn't mean to turn the planet into lava, right?"

"Of course not! I mean... yeah, it ferried everyone to my castle of judgment, but..."

"It's just one of the possible consequences of messing with time. So many changes can really mess with the planet's structure. But you figured it out, right? It's not the foolproof way to fix the island that you wanted."

"Yeah. Yeah, I think you beat that into me."

"So learned your lesson. You got access to a power you shouldn't have had, it went wrong, and you regret it. You deserve a second chance to do your thing. Without the consequences of the first attempt."

"...So... Does that mean you can fix it so they don't hate my guts anymore?"

"...Sorry, Mu. Time's already been fixed. And I can't spare another Time Piece, or I won't be able to get home." Hat Kid shook her head.

"Hmm? What do you mean, you won't get home without them?"

"They're spaceship fuel."

"No they're not."

"It's true!"

"How can *time* be a fuel?!" Mu sat up, and Hat Kid got a good look at her drowsy, cold-addled expression.

"I can't really explain that. Trade secret."

"Pfeh. How far away is home, anyway?"

"About five light years away from here."

"Light... years?" 

"Uhh... light travels really, *really* fast, right?"

"Yeah...?"

"Imagine travelling that fast for five years straight."

"What the hell? You aliens are freaky."

"Thanks." Hat Kid stuck her tongue out.

"But... okay, I guess I get why you'd be worried about that."

Hat Kid nodded. "But, I can maybe offer something else for you." She took a moment to think it through, then gave a soft smile. "I think you once wanted to be space adventurers together?"

"I think I remember. I'm guessing the 'time-travelling' part is off the table?"

"Duh. How attached do you feel to this planet?"

Mu stared at her, jaw dropping. In another timeline, they'd beaten each other up at the end of Time itself - and now this kid was willing to just let it go and be friends again?

What did she do to earn this?

"...I..." Mu opened and closed her mouth a couple times. "... you're joking, right? People just don't *do* things like that."

"People *here* don't do things like that."

"True. Uhh... well... The main thing is Seaside is my home... or was."

"Seaside?"

"I refuse to call it Mafia Town." She spat off into the distance. "But over the years, anyone who... who might have once called me family, or even just a friend, has taken off. I once had a roof over my head, a home, I didn't have to steal food..."

Mu sighed, and looked down into her lap. "Seaside is a shell of what it once was. It's only gotten worse since the Mafia have taken over. And I can't really go anywhere else. That bird country won't accept non-bird migrants, Subcon is... well you know, and I may be pretty outspoken, but I don't have the lung capacity for the Alps." Glancing up to Hat Kid's face, she deeply sighed. "So please... if you don't really have a place for me, just... just say so. I don't think I could... I could take it if I just got strung along on a joke."
