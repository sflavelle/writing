It was a cold evening in Mafia Town when Mustache Girl finally stirred.

Even after the few days she had spent unconscious, her being ached, fatigued and drained. Had she come down with a cold? Figures.

Blearily opening her eyes, she was greeted with flickering light cast upon the ceiling of what she recognised as her camp. In the corner of her vision she saw its source - her campfire was lit.

Oh this was not good. 

Mu struggled to sit up, nearly falling right back into sleep.

"Hey. Relax. You've been through a lot."

She froze. Blinking her eyes into focus, she saw that she indeed had a visitor.

It was that damn Hat Kid. And looking at herself, it seemed the alien had brought a pillow and spare blanket for Mu. But... why?

Mu sighed and flopped back under the blanket she had been given. "...Come to rub it in, huh."
