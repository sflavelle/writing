When Alex found themselves alive in the quiet alleys of Mafia Town, exactly as they had begun the day, someone was there to greet them.

They didn't recognise the rotund figure at first, but they *did* recognise the way their limbs twitched and juddered unnaturally, as if experiencing the world through a poor internet connection.

"Do not be alarmed," their familiar voice spoke as Alex blinked their eyes a few more times. "We haven't met, but I am a friend. I can see that you are caught in a rather strange loop."

"...Uh... yes, I suppose so. Not a time loop, I hope." Alex climbed into their feet. "You are the Badge Seller, I understand."

"That is... correct." Its mask was kind of unnerving to see in person. "Do not worry, you are only out of sync with Time in this universe."

"... actually, that sounds terrifying."

"Allow me to explain." They rested the butt of their staff against the ground, and for a moment Alex thought they saw its vertices jiggle with the force from the collision, like an old console model. "When you were brought here, the state of Time on this planet was in no state to accept you, being quite distorted by events that I'm sure I don't need to repeat to you. And when the Hat Child rewound Time by means of her Time Pieces to restore what had been lost, Time could not rewind you back through the opening through which you were brought here. Time in your reality, and Time in ours, do not operate in the same way."

"... How do you know this?" Alex's eyes were wide as they parsed what they had just been told.

"I have been to many places. Many realities, even. I have seen many things. I have come to understand that what Reality is is not always set in stone. It can be influenced, become fluid, immaterial. But Time is a constant, immutable. Each universe's Time is governed by its own rules, and can't be changed or manipulated. ... Every universe runs on its own clock, as it were."

Alex *stared*. "Uh... so... are you saying that this world, this 'reality'... influenced mine enough with the that someone here could pull me into it?" They gave themselves a moment to think. "And then... because supposedly my Time doesn't do Time travel, or rewinding, something like that, it won't accept me back in that way?"

"That's certainly a possibility. We won't know more without a more thorough examination of both our Realities and Times."

"I'm... Not sure I'm qualified for that."
