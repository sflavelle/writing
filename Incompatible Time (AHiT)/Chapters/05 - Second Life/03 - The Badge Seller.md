The third time Alex found themselves alive in the quiet alleys of Mafia Town, someone was there to greet them.

They didn't recognise the rotund figure at first, but they *did* recognise the way their limbs twitched and juddered unnaturally, as if experiencing the world through a poor connection.

"Do not be alarmed," their familiar voice spoke as Alex blinked their eyes a few more times. "We haven't met, but I am a friend. I can see that you are caught in a rather strange loop."

"...Uh... yes, I suppose so. Not a time loop, I hope." Alex climbed into their feet. "You are the Badge Seller, I understand."

"That is... correct." Its mask was kind of unnerving to see in person. "Do not worry, you are only out of sync with Time in this universe."

"... actually, that sounds terrifying."

"Allow me to explain." They rested the butt of their staff against the ground, and for a moment Alex thought they saw their vertices jiggle, like an old console model. "When you were brought here, the state of Time on this planet was in no state to accept you, being quite distorted by events that I'm sure I don't need to repeat to you. And when the Hat Child rewound Time by means of her Time Pieces to restore what had been lost, Time could not rewind you back through the portal through which you were brought here. Time in your reality, and Time in ours, do not operate in the same way."

"So... what does that mean?"
