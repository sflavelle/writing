"What in the--!"

In the same instant, the Dead Bird Studios sets were thrown into chaos as owls and penguins alike were suddenly laden with the memory of a future that no longer existed.

On opposite ends of the studio, both The Conductor and DJ Grooves were seen to suddenly throw their hands to their head, groaning as the memory of what they'd seen - and the memory of their sacrifices to help their star actor - were impressed upon them as if they had just experienced it in its totality just a moment ago.

Because, for them, it had.

"CUT!" called the Conductor once he remembered where he was. "What in the peck just... eugh..." He shuffled off of his director's chair in the direction of the kitchen. "Take an hour, you lot. Somethin' big's just 'appened. Need ter... need ter reset."

He glanced back toward the set, the other part of him remembering what movie they had been shooting for now/back then. In fact, he remembered shooting this scene before he had discovered *Groooooves* and that Hat Kid scheming. And discovering her fondness for their new props.

*What new props?* Part of him piped up. *We don't have any new props.*

*What? No, we had those hourglass props,* he thought back to himself, to the present... past... whatever version of himself was still experiencing today in linear time. *The Time Pieces. We taunted Groooooves and his penguins with them this morning, didn't we?*

*No?* He got back. *Am I goin' senile or somethin'?*

Ah.

*No,* The Conductor settled on. *The Lass must've fixed it all.*

Would he see her again?

He pushed open the door to the cafeteria, still lost in his thoughts, but paused on seeing the other director already here, leaning next to the coffee machine with cup in hand, drinking away. *Guess he had the same idea.* He decided to help himself to a coffee as well, giving the other director a nod.

There was a brief silence between the two of them. Not the bitter, awkward silence that they normally had when forced to share the same space. No, this was the silence of having just been through something *awful* together - him, Grooves and a bunch of other weirdos from across the planet.

DJ Grooves was the first to finish his coffee.

"I guess it worked, then," he said in his deep voice, and the Conductor noted the lack of character in it, the lack of affectations.

"We saved 'er, lad," the owl nodded once he'd downed his drink.

"And the little darlin' saved all of us."

"I'll drink to that."
