"What in the--!"

In the same instant, the Dead Bird Studios sets were thrown into chaos as owls and penguins alike were suddenly laden with the memory of a future that no longer existed.

On opposite ends of the studio, both The Conductor and DJ Grooves were seen to suddenly throw their hands to their head, groaning as the memory of what they'd seen - and the memory of their sacrifices to help their star actor - were impressed upon them as if they had just experienced it in its totality just a moment ago.

Because, for them, they had.

"CUT!" called the Conductor once he remembered where he was. "What in the peck just... eugh..." He shuffled off of his director's chair in the direction of the kitchen. "Take an hour, you lot. Somethin' big's just 'appened. Need ter... need ter reset."

He glanced back toward the set, the other part of him remembering what movie they had been shooting for now/back then. In fact, these were the final scenes he shot before the film was complete. Soon he'd send it away, post-production would do their thing, and he'd have a *brilliant* action entry for the Bird Movie Awards, glittering with their hourglass props.

*What new props?* Part of him piped up. *We don't have any new props.*

*What? No, we had those hourglass props,* he thought back to himself, to the present... past... whatever version of himself was still experiencing today in linear time. *The Time Pieces. We taunted Groooooves and his penguins with them early in production, didn't we?*

*No?* He got back. *Am I goin' senile already or somethin'?*

Ah.

*No,* The Conductor settled on. *Guess it's never happened, now. Lass must've fixed it all up.*

Would he see her again?

He pushed open the door to the cafeteria, still lost in his thoughts, but paused on seeing the other director already here, leaning next to the coffee machine with cup in hand, drinking away. *Guess he had the same idea.* He decided to help himself to a coffee as well, giving the other director a nod.

There was a brief silence between the two of them. Not the bitter, awkward silence that they normally had when forced to share the same space. No, this was the silence of having just been through something *awful* together - him, Grooves and a bunch of other weirdos from across the planet.

DJ Grooves was the first to finish his coffee.

"I guess it worked, then," he said in his deep voice, and the Conductor noted the lack of character in it, the lack of affectations.

"We saved 'er, lad," the owl nodded once he'd downed his drink.

"And she... saved all of us."

"I'll drink to that."

The two watched as crew from both teams filtered into the room. A few glanced over at the directors, seemingly seeking approval to be in the room. The Conductor nodded toward them. *'Course you're allowed in here, laddie.*

Some of the owls and penguins, they noticed, also seemed to have just, for lack of a better phrase, 'returned' from the other reality, whatever that red-hooded peckneck had done. The directors could pick out fearful or confused faces amongst the crowd.
