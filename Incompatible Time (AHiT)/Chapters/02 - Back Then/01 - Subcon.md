## Back Then

It was one of Snatcher's guilty pleasures, the book he was currently reading.

He hardly considered himself a fiction reader, having learned so much, of law, of the world, through books. Why muddle that knowledge with information that didn't apply?

But this? This was the one series he considered his exception. The *Ace the Attorney* novels.

Right now, as his spectral body rested in his chair, in the one place in the Forest he could truly call 'his home', the main character of the novel, Ace, was defending his client from a murder charge.

"*'Almost Christmas' means it wasn't Christmas!*" Snatcher allowed himself a chuckle upon reading the line. Yes, it sounded dumb, but it was small details like that which made all the difference, and he knew it. Surely this would be how Ace gets his client--

Snatcher jolted upright in a flash, the book completely forgotten as he looked around himself. *Where? Where was he now?!* A voice in his mind told him that he'd always been here, but a second voice, still his own, told him he had just been somewhere else completely.

He gathered his thoughts. He was just in that... *void*, for lack of a better word, and now he was here. 

And his Forest. He floated out of his chair to survey the path toward the village. It was the same as it always was, but it had also, last he saw, been lost under unending lava flow.

It was almost as if...

*That was it. Time, Time Pieces* - he'd been sent back in time, to a point before those changes happened.

*Was it over, then? Were things back to normal?*

He reached his senses outward. His minions - were they alright? His memory from this day told him they were, and that some were gathered near the bridge playing some 'tag' game. He felt the familiar sense of the minions there, and sighed out.

*Seems like things were as they should be.*

He glanced up toward the sky. Though the ever-present night in his Forest clouded the view, he knew that that Kid's 'spaceship' was up there. 

Perhaps it was time to make a visit.
