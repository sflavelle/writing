"What is it this time, Grooves?" The Conductor growled as he entered the boardroom. "I'm *so close* to bein' done with our movie!"

"I know, I know. Lock the door. I'll be quick, darlin'." DJ Grooves gestured to a seat by him. "I just want to check up on you, to be perfectly honest."

"Well, I'm *fine*. Just shook up." Conductor's voice showed exasperation, as if Grooves was *far* from the first to ask if he was 'okay' today. There was a soft click as the lock engaged, and the Conductor eyed the penguin warily as he took his seat. "It's been a wild coupl'a months, and yet... 'tis as if it was a rotten nightmare."

"We'll take it though, right?"

"Oh fer sure."

"But that's... not quite what I'm asking."

Grooves lifted his glasses away from his face, setting them down on the table. "I mean... how does the next few weeks go? Becoming more self-centered, feeding into some of your worse characteristics, right up to and after the Bird Movie Awards presentation... leading up to you *pulling a knife* on your star, and almost... eurgh... splattering her all over the walls of the basement."

"Don't remind me," Conductor spat, his features contorted in disgust. "Never thought I coulda sunk so low."

"But what about *this* time around?" Grooves rested a flipper against his colleague's shoulder. "We have a chance to do things right by her."

"This time? There won't *be* a 'this time'."

Grooves tilted his head to the side.

"Look, I... I know this just sounds like I'm makin' excuses, but those Time Pieces we had... they did somethin' to my head. I wasn't... thinking the way I normally do. Ah just... how do I explain? Holdin' that much *potential* in my hands... I really did feel like I could do anything."

"It *was* a rather intoxicating feeling, wasn't it?"

"Ha, see, ah knew you couldn't relate. ...'ang on, what?" His head spun to face Grooves. "You felt it too?"

"Ashamed to say I did, darlin'." Grooves sighed, tilting the chair back to look up at the ceiling. "When I held them, I thought - no, I knew - I could win the Award this time." He threw his flipper out in front of him. "Surely, my losing streak would be over! I could have the past Awards that *I knew* I had deserved!"

"But ye didn't go for it, lad. What 'appened?"

The penguin chuckled. "It's the darndest thing. It promised me so much, but I didn't think I could do it. So I gave them to someone who needed the confidence."

"The lass..."

"Indeed." Grooves sighed, and rested his flippers on his front. "Just, be mindful, old friend. We may not have had the Time Pieces anymore, but you and I still know a fair bit about working ourselves way too hard."

"You do?" The conductor chuckled. "And here I was, thinkin' all yer made were feel good pieces."

"Implying I don't chew through hundreds of takes trying to get my actors to perform." Grooves joined him in the laughter. 

Conductor smiled. "And whose fault is that, peckneck?" He responded lightheartedly.

"Our little diva, of course!" Grooves laughed harder. "She couldn't have come to us soon enough, darlin'!"

"We gotta get her in next year's movies!" The owl agreed, laughing with him.

The laughter lasted just a few seconds too long, and ended when the two realised there was another voice laughing with them.

Someone *in the room* with them.

"Who'ssat?!" Conductor growled. "I'll have you know this is a private meetin'!"

Someone - rather, something - blinked into existence opposite them at the boardroom table.

It was a strange entity, an almost completely black... *thing*, its only details two bright glowing eyes and a similarly luminescent fanged mouth, curled into a thin smile.

Both birds floundered backward, crashing out of their chairs.

"**YOU!**" cried the Conductor as he got to his feet first. He recognised that figure from the castle. "Yer that Soul Snatcher of Subcon Forest, ain't ye?!"

"***Just 'Snatcher' is fine. A pleasure to meet me properly, I'm sure.***" His smile grew into a grin.

After the Conductor's shock had worn off, he pulled one of his blades from his coat and brandished it at the Snatcher. "I dunno how yer got here, but yer **not** gettin' anywhere near my soul!"

"***Any other day, birdbrain.***" Snatcher reclined in the chair he'd chosen. "***No, I'm just playing messenger today, and I'm rather glad I've found the both of you in one place. I'm afraid I bear the bad news that your... 'diva' is about to leave the planet for good.***"

"What have you done to her?!" Grooves got to his feet, staring the spirit down.

"If you so much as lay a finger on 'er after everything she's done..." began the Conductor.

Snatcher shook his head. "***No, this was her decision. She's leaving us to go back to her home planet. And I'd like you to convince her to stay.***"
