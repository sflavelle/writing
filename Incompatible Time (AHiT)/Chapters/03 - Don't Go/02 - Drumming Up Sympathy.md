"What is it this time, Grooves?" The Conductor growled as he entered the boardroom. "I'm *so close* to bein' done with our movie!"

"I know, i know. I'll be quick, darlin'." DJ Grooves gestured to a seat by him. "I just want to check up on you, to be perfectly honest."

"Well, I'm *fine*. Just shook up." The owl took a deep breath. "I keep half-expectin' lava to start pourin' through the doors."

"I understand, but that's not what i mean, darlin'." Grooves lifted his glasses away from his face, setting them down on the table. "I mean... before all that, you tried to murder our star. If I remember right, you wanted to use that Time Piece of hers to undo my only victory in our rivalry."

"...Not my proudest moment," He admitted, taking another breath.

"But what about *this* time around?" Grooves rested a flipper against his colleague's shoulder. "Neither of us have those Time Pieces anymore, but i know how much the stress of directing is."

"You do?" The conductor chuckled. "And here i was, thinkin' all yer made were feel good pieces."

"Implying I don't chew through hundreds of takes trying to get my actors to perform." Grooves joined him in the laughter. 

Conductor smiled. "And whose fault is that, peckneck?" He responded lightheartedly.

"Our little diva, of course!" Grooves laughed harder. "She couldn't have come to us soon enough, darlin'!"

"We gotta get her in next year's movies," The owl agreed.

"***About that...***"

Someone - rather, something - blinked into existence opposite them at the boardroom table.

It was unmistakably the Subcon Snatcher.

After the Conductor's shock had worn off, he pulled one of his blades from his coat and brandished it at the Snatcher. "I dunno how yer got here, but yer **not** gettin' anywhere near my soul!"

"***Any other day, birdbrain.***" Snatcher reclined in the chair he'd chosen. "***I'm glad I've found the both of you in one place. I'm afraid I bear the bad news that your... 'diva' is about to leave the planet for good.***"

"What have you done to her?!" Grooves got to his feet, staring the spirit down.

"If you so much as lay a finger on 'er after everything she's done..." began the Conductor.

"***No, you morons! She wants to take her spaceship and leave! I don't want her to go, am i right in saying the two of you don't want to see her leave?***"
