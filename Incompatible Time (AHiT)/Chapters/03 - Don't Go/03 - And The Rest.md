The Mafia Boss of Cooks was not expecting visitors from out of town. 

Many Mafia acted as if he hadn't lost his body in the first place. While he had not been fond of the experience, it struck him as odd, that only a small number of his crew truly remembered what he realised was now a past version of events, while he got to remember the period where he was a pair of eyes and a moustache floating in liquefied ... he didn't care to think about that too much.

So when several Mafia burst into his theatre yelling about ghosts, it took him a bit longer than he would have liked to realise that the Snatcher was involved. Having traveled around the world, he should have known that only one entity ventures so far out from the Subcon Forest.

And so, when the ghost indeed appeared before him, floating in through the doors (and promptly scaring off the mafia guarding them), the Mafia Boss was amused. "The Subcon Snatcher graces me with his presence! To what do I owe this unexpected surprise?"

"*Always straight to business with you, huh?*" The Snatcher grinned. "*Good! I'll make this quick.*"

With a snap of his fingers the contract appeared before the Mafia Boss. "*That kid with the hat is planning to leave, and I wondered if you, like me, have any objections with the idea.*"

"Of course I do!" Was the Boss's response. "She is rude and has no respect! But she is a damn good fighter, and I'll be damned if she leaves us on some flight of fancy!"

"*She wants to go home.*"

"Details! I will sign."

"*Good choice, my friend.*"
