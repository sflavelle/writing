The Mafia Boss of Cooks was not expecting visitors from out of town. 

Many Mafia acted as if he hadn't lost his body in the first place. While he had not been fond of the experience, it struck him as odd, that only a small number of his crew truly remembered what he realised was now a past version of events, while he got to remember the period where he was a pair of eyes and a moustache floating in liquefied ... he didn't care to think about that too much.

So when several Mafia burst into his theatre yelling about ghosts, it took him a bit longer than he would have liked to realise that the Snatcher was involved. Having traveled around the world, he should have known that only one entity ventures so far out from the Subcon Forest.

And so, when the ghost indeed appeared before him, floating in through the doors (and promptly scaring off the mafia guarding them), the Mafia Boss was amused. "The Subcon Snatcher graces me with his presence! To what do I owe this unexpected surprise?"

"*Always straight to business with you, huh?*" The Snatcher grinned. "*Good! I'll make this quick.*"

With a snap of his fingers the contract appeared before the Mafia Boss. "*That kid with the hat is planning to leave, and I wondered if you, like me, have any objections with the idea.*"

"Of course I do!" Was the Boss's response. "She is rude and has no respect! But she is a damn good fighter, and I'll be damned if she leaves us on some flight of fancy!"

"*She wants to go home.*"

"Details! I will sign."

"*Good choice, my friend.*"

"Excuse me, mister Snatcher sir?"

Snatcher paused on his way descending from the casino. A small feminine voice had reached him. Not the Kid's, but... the Mafia didn't employ kids *or* women. So who...?

"Psst, over to your left."

His head turned toward a balcony.

There it was. It was a cat, but... it wore a cook's outfit. Who...? "I don't suppose I could, speak with you privately?"

Snatcher raised an eyebrow. He slowly drew closer, his fuzz a deep black. As he approached the cat, it was as if the light was being drained from the world, leaving his glowing yellow features the only light.

Then, out of nowhere, lightning struck in the distance, and the world lit up again, finding them in a purple 'void', lined with dead trees.

The Snatcher towered over the animal. In a deep, low voice, he spoke, "*You must be either very brave or very foolish to seek audience with me. Which is it?*"

"Why, you are *just* as spooky as the Kid said!" The cat beamed up at him. "Pleasure to make your acquaintance. I am Cooking Cat, TV chef extraordinaire! There's word among the Mafia you're trying to get the alien to stay."

Snatcher stared at her. "*What's a 'TV'? No, hang on - they're blabbing* already? *I just got out of there!*"

She shrugged. "You should know that I've been investigating that alien and her spaceship for a few days, and if you'll have me, I may be able to help appeal to her."

"*I've never seen you when I've visited.*"

"I may have been *mostly* investigating the alien food."

"*Ooooof course you were. Also, only a couple days?*"

"It's the strangest thing! I decided to come on before she left Mafia Town. She said she was going to do some movies for the birds at Dead Bird Studios and said she'd be here a while, and next thing I know, she says she's finished and was leaving tonight, and where could she drop me off?"

Snatcher thought a moment. Interesting... this cat didn't mention Lava World at all. Compared to the few he'd talked to in the past 24 hours, it seemed Cooking Cat had no idea about the future that had already occurred and been subsequently erased. "*Weeell... I wouldn't normally do this, but okay. Myself, the Boss and the two directors of Dead Bird Studios are going up there tonight. I can bring you along, but I'll have to get you to sign something, and it's only because of a trait I know the Kid'll adore.*"

"Of course! What do you mean?"

"*You're disgustingly...* adorable, *and you have fur. She'll love that.*"

"You flatter me, mister Snatcher!"

"*Don't get too comfortable with me.*" The contract appeared again, with quill. "*If you accept what you'll be getting into, just add your signature.*"

"Absolutely!"
