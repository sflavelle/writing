...and looked back to the road to see ...

... huge vines and roots suddenly sprouting across the road in front of you.

There was no time to react.

You slammed on the brakes a second before you hit the sudden obstacle doing 65 kilometers an hour.

...

You stumbled out of the vehicle, shuffling with your bleeding scalp and head injuries over to the side of the road, where you promptly laid down on the grass, clutching your head.

You heard the earth rumble around you, and ignored it.

"Well, golly! About time you stopped to listen to me!"

Oh, god *damn it*.

You cracked an eye open when you were sprayed with dirt once more.

Yep, there he was. 

You stared up at the grinning flower that had sprouted up next to you.
