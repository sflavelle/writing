Waking up from being effectively dead/in a coma by being shaken awake was not a pleasant experience, you decided.

When your glassy eyes vacantly stared at him, barely processing that you were awake and alive, Jevil cursed himself. He quickly got to work, carefully lifting you onto his back and carrying you from the room in which you had apparently been resting.

Slowly, as you were hurriedly carried out of some civilian building out onto the streets, you started to become aware of what was happening around you.

People running about around you.

The sounds of demolition and explosions in the distance.

And red strings *everywhere* you looked.

Also, hang on... weren't you *taller* than your travel companion? Not... shorter, apparently?

You mumbled into his shoulder, "s'mthin happening...?"

"Oh, oh!" Jevil immediately responded with growing delight, turning his head to nuzzle into the top of your head. "Welcome back, my dear friend! It's good to have you with me once more! Sadly this reality is under attack, attack! So we must away, away!"

You took a few moments to process his words. "By... runnin'...?"

"Just for a moment! Using my magic *here* will surely attract the wrong attention, so we must find a safe place to do so. Please hold tight!" Once the imp felt your legs and arms tighten around him, he grinned and increased his pace, running down the street.

You were both coming up on a park, and Jevil immediately ducked into it, hiding amongst the trees and bushes as they followed a path into its depths.
