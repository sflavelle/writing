*(When the AHIT/UT crew visit a Classic universe while inside an Undertale subverse (UTMV), one of the extra characters living with the UT main cast is Lily, the inkling from Begin Again. How did she get there? This would be a one-shot that tells her story.)*

*(This snippet starts from when Lily and Eight try to superjump back into the portal back to their universe.)*

Seeing Eight disappear into the shrinking portal back into the depths of NILS, as she rocketed up behind him, gave her hope.

But then the otherworldly 'boom' and tearing sound dominated her hearing, the sound she had heard that signalled the appearance of the portal...

And just a few feet from the portal...

It burst into energy, dissipating around her.

And she was stuck here, in this... whereever this forest was.

At least the sky is nice and clear.

She unshifted from her swim form, her trajectory now setting her up for a rough awkward landing on the hill below.

She hit the ground hard, crumpling and bouncing hard on the grass until she came to a stop at the base of the hill.

Everything was pain.

She laid there for a minute, thoroughly rattled, her only hope being that she wasn't too far from Inkopolis.

As the ringing in her ears from the impact subsided, she became aware of a quiet voice nearby.

"...oh... oh no... are you hurt...? ...sorry, that was a stupid question... oh dear..."

Slowly, Lily opened her eyes, turning her head to find the source of the voice...

Her eyes eventually landing on what looked like a sheet ghost a few meters away, floating over from the treeline.

Any doubt she has that this was just a kid messing with her faded when she noted it *was* translucent.

It froze in place as she looked at it, breathing quickly, but it seemed to force itself to calm down and approach her. "this... this looks really bad... um... don't... don't try to move too much... i'll... go get some help, okay...?"

The ghost faded away.

*Great, I'm losing my mind,* Lily thought to herself sluggishly. She carefully tested the range of motion in her arm. It was definitely sore, but not unbearable. Carefully she brought her hand to her headset, carefully thumbing the transmit button. "Agent 5 to Central, I-- ow... Tartar has managed to remove me from the facility. No clue where I am. Eight is on his own. I'm... figuring out a plan for returning to Inkopolis. Please acknowledge."

She released the button and let herself lay there on the damp grass, waiting for a reply over the headset radio.

...A reply that didn't come, even after a minute.

The beginnings of dread settled into her gut as she reached for the transmit button again. "Agent 5 to... to all Squidbeak Splatoon, please acknowledge."

She waited for less time this time, only twenty seconds, but the ongoing silence gave her the impression that something was deeply wrong. She carefully traced along the surface of the headset, trying to remember the gestures to activate the emergency broadcast mode, but as she drew the lines along the touch surface-

"*'Agent 5', this is Doctor Alphys of Ebott University. This is a restricted communication frequency for Ebott scientific staff. I um... is this a roleplay of some kind?*"

Lily's brows furrowed, a mix of pain and confusion. She racked her brain, trying to remember whereabouts a settlement called Ebott might be in relation to Inkopolis City. ...However, nothing came to mind. "No ma'am," she responded. "I... don't think I've heard of Ebott before. Although considering I just saw a ghost, I wouldn't be surprised I'm losing my mind."

"*A ghost...? Oh, was it Napstablook? I know them. Uh... for what it's worth, I've never heard of Inkopolis either. Do you need help...? I can try to triangulate your position, and send somebody over...*"

Lily blinked. *Oh, that wasn't good.* "Uh... yeah. Could use some assistance. The gho-- uh... 'Napstablook' said they were getting help, but I don't know what help they meant. I took a pretty bad fall."

"*G-got it. Hold tight, someone's on the way.*" The headset went silent. 

She silently took in the field around her. This clearing looked almost like a park of some sort, green and lush. It was maybe a bit greener than she'd seen in Inkopolis lately. 

It was... nice.

----

Her thoughts were soon interrupted by the sound of someone approaching, calling out. 

"Yo! Anyone out here?!" It was a female voice, someone... butch, perhaps? 

Lily took a deep breath, and responded. "This way!"

"I hear ya! Hold tight!" 

She slowly shifted into a sitting position as the person broke through the trees and spotted her. 

And... huh. That was the most human marine creature she'd seen so far. And holy shit she was tall compared to the inkling.

"There you are, kid! You're the one who called Alphys, right?!" The creature said as she approached, taking in the cephalopod. "Wait, what kinda... you a human or a monster, kid? You look like both."

*Human?! How'd she pick me out so quickly?!* "Uh, ahaha, um, j-just an Inkling, ma'am."

The other's brows furrowed. "What? Just an inkling that what? That's an answer to a question I *did not* ask." She crouched down and examined Lily for injuries, seeing all her bruises and the bullet wound in her shoulder from the NILS facility's turrets which had blown out a small jagged hole in the other end. "Holy shit, kid, what have you been doing? We need to get you healed up right away. C'mon, I know someone who can help." 

She grabbed Lily's hand and pulled her along, leading her into the trees. As she did, she took out a surprisingly human looking phone, and dialled someone. "Hey Alphy. Yeah I found 'em. Some kinda monster-human hybrid or something. Listen, uhh, they've been shot at some point, real bad. They need a heal. ... Yeah, they're moving mostly alright. ... You sure she'll do it? It's... a little gruesome... Alright, I'll meet you there. Yeah. Love ya too. Bye."

She hung up the phone, and looked again at Lily's shoulder. "... right, well, I'm gonna get you to somewhere safe, alright? No one is gonna hurt you there, you can rest up before you head back home."

Lily nodded dumbly. 

It wasn't long before they left the forest - more of a park, in retrospect- and re-entered a city...

And ran into a problem. 

Humans. 

Just... walking around. Like they weren't twelve thousand years dead. 

Lily yanked her hand back from the other creature with a terrified squeak, suddenly in a fight-or-flight mode. The other whirled around with a 'what in the hell' as the inkling scrambled first behind the shark/piranha creature who was leading her, then into a nearby alley, hiding behind a dumpster.

The taller quickly found them again, holding two small gun-lile weapons close to their chest. They quickly became concerned. "The hell's going on, punk?!"

"What do you mean, 'the hell is going on'?!" Lily snapped. "Humans have been dead for 12,000 years, why in the fuck are they just walking around like nothing happened?!"

"Wh--?? We hadn't even been underground for a *thousand* years, what do you mean humans are--??" The taller's eyes went wide, then her whole expression scrunched up like she was thinking hard.

As Lily watched, her companion's eyes went wide again, and her face seemed to soften, and she seemed to take in the inkling anew.

 Eventually she crouched next to her again, and asked in a hushed tone, "You're... you're not *from* here, are you? You're like... from one of Alphy's anime shows."
 
 Lily blinked. "...What."
 
"You know! The ones where the heroine is living a normal life and then she dies and appears in a fantasy world to find their TRUE PURPOSE!" She stood, and punched her fist into the air in exaggeration. "You look like one of those! What does she call 'em... eee... Isekai! Yeah! ...Except... the way you look, with your hi-tech lookin' gear, I guess maybe the opposite kinda happened, huh."

Lily stared, blankly as she took this in. Slowly she blinked, and focused on her companion. "Then... if that's true, just... where am I? ... can I find a way back?"

The other sighed. "I dunno, punk, but we're not gonna leave you to just fend for yourself in the meantime." She reached out a webbed hand to help up the Inkling. "Name's Undyne, by the way. Captain of the Royal Guard. Didn't think I'd need to introduce myself, didn't think this would be a longer term thing, but, well..."

Lily sighed, and used Undyne's hand to pull herself up. "Thanks. Lily Sunden, Agent 5 of the New Squidbeak Splatoon."

"Nice. You look like a soldier of some kind."

"...In a way I suppose I am. We protect our city, Inkopolis, from threats to the public wellbeing. More... behind the scenes though. If we do our job right, it's like nothing ever happened."

----

Having calmed Lily down, Undyne quickly moved her through the city.

Lily felt weird moving around humans again after so long, and yet in her new form nobody looked at her like an abomination. It wasn't just humans she saw on the streets though - there were many 'monsters' casually wandering through as well, of all kinds. Some were more 'humanoid' like herself and Undyne, and some were more animal, like a turtle walking around on four legs with a... rubber duck in a tub thing for a shell? They were all so vibrant and colourful and varied in such a way that the inkling felt they had, somewhere along the way, stepped into something more magical than the 'reality' they had lived for so long. 

As they passed a pub, Lily caught a sight of something on fire in the windows-- wait, when she focused she could see it was a *person* on fire behind the counter. In a sharp suit that somehow kept the flames at bay? "So uh... magic, huh?" she murmured. 

Undyne heard her, and grinned. "Yep! Monsters are all sorts, but the one thing we got in common is magic. Made of the stuff. Not this gross flesh and blood stuff humans have."

"That explains all the varied appearances," she told the guard. "Never seen anything like it."

Eventually she was ushered into an apartment building, Undyne handling the keycard, and in the common space she guided the inkling to a massive corner couch, where she joined (paling slightly) a sentient skeleton in a hoodie laying across some of the opposite side, and a sunflower *thing* in a pot on a table closer to the inkling. Both were focused on the television sitting against the opposing corner of the room, though they eyed Lily as Undyne guided her to sit. 

"Alright Lily, you hold tight. Tori will have your shoulder fixed up good as new! Just gotta find her." She turned to the skeleton. "She's not left or anything, has she?"

"pretty sure she's up, not left." the skeleton *winked*.

"UUUUGH," was the flower's response on Lily's right. 

"too easy. yeah, I think she's still reading with frisk, cap."

"Great. Make sure this one stays put while I get her." Then Undyne walked off, and up some stairs leading into the apartments.
