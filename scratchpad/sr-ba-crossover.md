*(When the AHIT/UT crew visit a Classic universe while visiting an Undertale subverse (UTMV), one of the extra characters living with the UT main cast is Lily, the inkling from Begin Again. How did she get there? This would be a one-shot that tells her story.)*

*(This snippet starts from when Lily and Eight try to superjump back into the portal back to their universe.)*

Seeing Eight disappear into the shrinking portal back into the depths of NILS, as she rocketed up behind him, gave her hope.

But then the otherworldly 'boom' and tearing sound dominated her hearing, the sound she had heard that signalled the appearance of the portal...

And just a few feet from the portal...

It burst into energy, dissipating around her.

And she was stuck here, in this... whereever this forest was.

She unshifted from her swim form, her trajectory now setting her up for a rough awkward landing on the hill below.

She hit the ground hard, crumpling and bouncing hard on the grass until she came to a stop at the base of the hill.

Everything was pain.

She laid there for a minute, thoroughly rattled, her only hope being that she wasn't too far from Inkopolis.

As the ringing in her ears from the impact subsided, she became aware of a quiet voice nearby.

"...oh... oh no... are you hurt...? ...sorry, that was a stupid question... oh dear..."

Slowly, Lily opened her eyes, turning her head to find the source of the voice...

Her eyes eventually landing on what looked like a sheet ghost a few meters away, floating over from the treeline. It froze in place as she looked at it, breathing quickly, but it seemed to force itself to calm down and approach her. "um... don't... don't try to move too much... i'll... go get some help, okay...?"

The ghost faded away.

*Great, I'm losing my mind,* Lily thought to herself sluggishly. She carefully tested the range of motion in her arm. It was definitely sore, but not unbearable. Carefully she brought her hand to her headset, carefully thumbing the transmit button. "Agent 5 to Central, I-- ow... Tartar has managed to remove me from the facility. No clue where I am. Eight is on his own. I'm... figuring out a plan for returning to Inkopolis. Please acknowledge."

She released the button and let herself lay there on the damp grass, waiting for a reply over the headset radio.

...A reply that didn't come, even after a minute.

The beginnings of dread settled into her gut as she reached for the transmit button again. "Agent 5 to... to all Squidbeak Splatoon, please acknowledge."

She waited for less time this time, only twenty seconds, but the ongoing silence gave her the impression that something was deeply wrong. She carefully traced along the surface of the headset, trying to remember the gestures to activate the emergency broadcast mode, but as she drew the lines along the touch surface-

"*'Agent 5', this is Doctor Alphys of Ebott University. This is a restricted communication frequency for Ebott scientific staff. I um... is this a roleplay of some kind?*"

Lily's brows furrowed, a mix of pain and confusion. She racked her brain, trying to remember whereabouts Ebott was in relation to Inkopolis City. ...However, nothing came to mind. "No ma'am," she responded. "I... don't think I've heard of Ebott before. Although considering I just saw a ghost, I wouldn't be surprised I'm losing my mind."

"*A ghost...? Oh, was it Napstablook? I know them. Uh... for what it's worth, I've never heard of Inkopolis either. Do you need help...? I can try to triangulate your position, and send somebody over...*"

Lily blinked. *Oh, that wasn't good.* "Uh... yeah. Could use some assistance. The gho-- uh... 'Napstablook' said they were getting help, but I don't know what help they meant. I took a pretty bad fall."
